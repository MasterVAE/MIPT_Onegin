[291] [26] Hor. Nay, good my lord -
[292] [28] What, is Horatio there ?
[293] [25] strumpet. What news ?
[294] [2] 
[295] [2] 
[296] [2] 
[297] [2] 
[298] [2] 
[299] [67] of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a
[300] [67] Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
[301] [67] chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a
[302] [63] purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
[303] [65] Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
[304] [67] speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be play'd on than a
[305] [60] Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
[306] [66] obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
[307] [61] Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
[308] [66] holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a
[309] [61] Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
[310] [68] Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
[311] [66] anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a
[312] [67] to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
[313] [59] whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
[314] [65] Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
[315] [11] Hecuba.
[316] [42] What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
[317] [15] For Hecuba!
[318] [40] That looks so many fadoms to the sea
[319] [44] That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
[320] [13] more, ha?
[321] [50] As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
[322] [16] Ophelia,'-
[323] [26] Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
[324] [37] Enter Ophelia.
[325] [38] Enter Ophelia.  
[326] [30] Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
[327] [47] In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia
[328] [50] Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
[329] [42] Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
[330] [22] Affront Ophelia.  
[331] [26] Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
[332] [43] Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
[333] [50] Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
[334] [26] Queen. How now, Ophelia?
[335] [23] King. Pretty Ophelia!
[336] [40] And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
[337] [43] Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
[338] [47] Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
[339] [68] (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
[340] [54] To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
[341] [46] 'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
[342] [54] Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
[343] [21] Come, some music!
[344] [68] lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,  
[345] [33] Pol. And let him ply his music.
[346] [25] Ham. No, by this bad.  
[347] [53] The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
[348] [46] Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
[349] [42] A second time I kill my husband dead
[350] [45] We should profane the service of the dead
[351] [47] That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
[352] [13] King. Dead.
[353] [38] But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
[354] [67] Clown. One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
[355] [55] But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
[356] [32] No, no, he is dead;  
[357] [55] Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.  
[358] [54] Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
[359] [45] Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
[360] [47] bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.
[361] [52] The source of this our watch, and the chief head
[362] [44] T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
[363] [59] Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  
[364] [42] Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
[365] [47] With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
[366] [43] Which was declining on the milky head
[367] [41] With all my imperfections on my head.
[368] [49] And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
[369] [45] He took my father grossly, full of bread,
[370] [46] But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
[371] [23] Ham. How came he mad?
[372] [30] Pol. That hath made him mad.
[373] [24] Queen. Alas, he's mad!
[374] [43] I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
[375] [45] What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
[376] [51] And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
[377] [50] And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
[378] [47] Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
[379] [60] 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
[380] [41] In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
[381] [39] Will sate itself in a celestial bed
[382] [43] When second husband kisses me in bed.
[383] [46] Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
[384] [69] Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
[385] [40] I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
[386] [45] Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
[387] [45] Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
[388] [48] An thou hadst not come to my bed.'
[389] [30] Go to thy deathbed;
[390] [69] If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
[391] [20] To be commanded.
[392] [35] Pol. This business is well ended.
[393] [52] Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
[394] [48] Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
[395] [22] Mar. It is offended.
[396] [49] Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
[397] [44] But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
[398] [45] As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
[399] [50] But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
[400] [46] To show yourself your father's son in deed
[401] [21] King. O heavy deed!
[402] [49] Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
[403] [47] Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
[404] [37] Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
[405] [43] Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
[406] [27] Stick fiery off indeed.
[407] [48] Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
[408] [49] Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
[409] [35] A combination and a form indeed
[410] [56] You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.
[411] [27] Queen. So he does indeed.
[412] [47] That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
[413] [50] Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
[414] [42] To keep it from divulging, let it feed
[415] [37] King. She sounds to see them bleed.
[416] [67] Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
[417] [51] And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
[418] [46] And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
[419] [63] enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,
[420] [67] For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
[421] [47] Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
[422] [62] 'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
[423] [23] To the unsatisfied.
[424] [38] I did repel his letters and denied
[425] [50] Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
[426] [54] Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
[427] [34] Her mood will needs be pitied.
[428] [41] King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
[429] [51] Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
[430] [45] Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
[431] [19] Ham. Pale or red?
[432] [30] Be all my sins rememb'red.
[433] [58] Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
[434] [68] hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred
[435] [45] That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
[436] [42] When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
[437] [46] Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
[438] [47] Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
[439] [66] journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
[440] [67] Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
[441] [42] Enter Ophelia distracted.
[442] [51] Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
[443] [56] With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
[444] [53] Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
[445] [53] Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
[446] [35] Which now goes too free-footed.
[447] [63] Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
[448] [48] The memory be green, and that it us befitted
[449] [40] Or like a creature native and indued
[450] [31] Oph. I was the more deceived.
[451] [47] So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
[452] [38] You promis'd me to wed.'
[453] [41] by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
[454] [46] Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
[455] [49] She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
[456] [46] Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
[457] [46] Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
[458] [48] 'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
[459] [45] Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
[460] [49] Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
[461] [44] Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
[462] [52] Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
[463] [51] Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
[464] [69] Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
[465] [57] And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
[466] [52] And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
[467] [52] Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
[468] [44] Let in the maid, that out a maid
[469] [55] I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
[470] [65] set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
[471] [47] You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
[472] [45] And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
[473] [53] Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid  
[474] [30] Come short of what he did.
[475] [22] Hor. My lord, I did;
[476] [53] Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
[477] [40] In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
[478] [40] Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
[479] [48] Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
[480] [45] Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
[481] [32] Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
[482] [66] Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
[483] [51] Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
[484] [46] So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
[485] [67] Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
[486] [27] Hor. How was this seal'd?
[487] [39] Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
[488] [25] man is twice a child.
[489] [41] But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
[490] [46] Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
[491] [51] In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
[492] [44] To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
[493] [47] Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
[494] [58] Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
[495] [47] A little month, or ere those shoes were old
[496] [69] Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
[497] [45] And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
[498] [44] To mine own room again; making so bold  
[499] [54] Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
[500] [47] Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
[501] [27] To what I shall unfold.
[502] [68] Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
[503] [49] Should have a back or second, that might hold
[504] [43] An understanding simple and unschool'd;
[505] [10] world.
[506] [45] I do not know from what part of the world
[507] [35] Laer. My will, not all the world!
[508] [47] And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
[509] [42] Seem to me all the uses of this world!
[510] [43] In the corrupted currents of this world
[511] [65] Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
[512] [47] No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
[513] [60] As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
[514] [47] That treason can but peep to what it would,
[515] [66] would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
[516] [33] Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
[517] [45] But let this same be presently perform'd,
[518] [29] Hor. You might have rhym'd.
[519] [62] a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
[520] [67] Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
[521] [69] have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
[522] [68] speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
[523] [63] Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and  
[524] [64] Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
[525] [65] Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
[526] [65] them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
[527] [61] crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper's ears, and
[528] [69] rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
[529] [67] only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and
[530] [64] full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and
[531] [46] And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
[532] [26] Laer. Know you the hand?
[533] [49] The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
[534] [40] But to recover of us, by strong hand
[535] [38] If by direct or by collateral hand
[536] [45] Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
[537] [49] Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
[538] [46] The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
[539] [45] So nightly toils the subject of the land,
[540] [44] And hath shipped me intil the land,
[541] [46] Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
[542] [51] Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
[543] [48] I cannot live to hear the news from England,
[544] [51] You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
[545] [52] Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
[546] [17] into England.
[547] [47] Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
[548] [16] For England.
[549] [52] one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
[550] [60] Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
[551] [19] Ham. For England?
[552] [50] The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;  
[553] [38] Capt. Against some part of Poland.  
[554] [56] Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
[555] [44] You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
[556] [47] Th' important acting of your dread command?
[557] [49] Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
[558] [46] An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
[559] [46] Put your dread pleasures more into command
[560] [41] (O royal knavery!), an exact command,
[561] [64] Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
[562] [64] Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand  
[563] [31] pick'd out of ten thousand.
[564] [44] I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
[565] [54] Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
[566] [32] Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
[567] [8] end.
[568] [38] died. They say he made a good end.
[569] [7] THE END
[570] [41] No more; and by a sleep to say we end
[571] [44] And each particular hair to stand an end
[572] [48] As make your bouts more violent to that end-
[573] [50] For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
[574] [46] For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
[575] [49] And You must put me in your heart for friend,
[576] [16] your friend.
[577] [12] Perpend.
[578] [46] I, his sole son, do this same villain send
[579] [45] And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
[580] [52] Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
[581] [52] King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;  
[582] [50] Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
[583] [41] And carriage of the article design'd,
[584] [48] That have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
[585] [41] If circumstances lead me, I will find
[586] [52] And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
[587] [46] Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
[588] [37] I must be cruel, only to be kind;
[589] [58] Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
[590] [46] Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
[591] [51] Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.  
[592] [48] That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
[593] [28] To hear him so inclin'd.
[594] [9] mind.
[595] [48] With all the strength and armour of the mind
[596] [43] Take these again; for to the noble mind
[597] [65] lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
[598] [43] The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
[599] [45] Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
[600] [29] And for his death no wind
[601] [56] To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
[602] [48] Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
[603] [48] And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
[604] [50] That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
[605] [47] Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
[606] [38] Capt. Yes, it is already garrison'd.
[607] [40] Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
[608] [46] And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
[609] [45] Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
[610] [49] King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
[611] [26] Are joyfully return'd.
[612] [54] That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
[613] [44] Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
[614] [45] And, like a man to double business bound,
[615] [46] As it hath us'd to do- that I have found  
[616] [48] He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
[617] [42] But better look'd into, he truly found
[618] [44] He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
[619] [30] Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
[620] [57] King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
[621] [51] Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
[622] [42] It waves you to a more removed ground.
[623] [67] choose but weep to think they would lay him i' th' cold ground.
[624] [42] We go to gain a little patch of ground
[625] [45] Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
[626] [50] Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
[627] [30] Hor. Friends to this ground.
[628] [24] Ham. Upon what ground?
[629] [48] Your party in converse, him you would sound,
[630] [26] Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
[631] [34] Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
[632] [64] Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
[633] [49] His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
[634] [13] Ham. O God!
[635] [31] Laer. Do you see this, O God?
[636] [66] which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
[637] [52] Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
[638] [44] That to the use of actions fair and good
[639] [64] Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
[640] [46] No medicine in the world can do thee good.
[641] [14] Ham. Good.  
[642] [47] Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
[643] [42] It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
[644] [67] Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
[645] [65] My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
[646] [43] Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
[647] [38] A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
[648] [52] As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
[649] [53] Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
[650] [42] Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
[651] [53] Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
[652] [50] Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
[653] [56] Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
[654] [42] Excitements of my reason and my blood,
[655] [30] Repast them with my blood.
[656] [44] O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
[657] [45] So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
[658] [34] Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
[659] [53] Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
[660] [68] great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
[661] [55] Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
[662] [40] Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
[663] [47] Never to speak of this that you have heard:
[664] [47] Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
[665] [59] Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd  
[666] [46] His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
[667] [44] As did that one; and that, in my regard,
[668] [42] Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
[669] [48] Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
[670] [50] Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
[671] [48] 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
[672] [48] Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
[673] [56] King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
[674] [60] Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
[675] [61] Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
[676] [32] Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
[677] [67] should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  
[678] [44] A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
[679] [23] Elsinore. A churchyard.
[680] [47] That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
[681] [55] Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.  
[682] [62] To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
[683] [21] A sable silver'd.
[684] [49] Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
[685] [41] Enter a Lord.
[686] [22] Laer. My dread lord,
[687] [37] 1. Play. What speech, my good lord?
[688] [42] Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
[689] [20] Mar. My good lord!
[690] [25] Rey. But, my good lord-
[691] [24] Osr. Ay, my good lord.
[692] [49] Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
[693] [25] Guil. My honour'd lord!
[694] [31] Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
[695] [52] I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,  
[696] [53] O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
[697] [25] Ros. My most dear lord!
[698] [23] Hor. O, my dear lord!
[699] [30] Guil. In what, my dear lord?
[700] [66] Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
[701] [64] [Exit Lord.]
[702] [18] read, my lord?
[703] [49] Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
[704] [23] Both. Arm'd, my lord.
[705] [28] Ros. To what end, my lord?
[706] [20] Oph. Good my lord,
[707] [42] Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
[708] [20] Ros. Good my lord!
[709] [24] Hor. Ay, good my lord.
[710] [26] Rey. Very good, my lord.
[711] [54] Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
[712] [33] Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
[713] [48] Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
[714] [35] Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
[715] [41] Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
[716] [37] Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
[717] [31] Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
[718] [24] Oph. At home, my lord.
[719] [34] Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
[720] [19] There, my lord.
[721] [25] Hor. O, where, my lord?
[722] [31] Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
[723] [33] Pol. That's very true, my lord.
[724] [48] Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
[725] [23] Pol. I have, my lord.
[726] [27] Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
[727] [31] Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
[728] [25] Guil. A thing, my lord?
[729] [32] Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
[730] [26] Rey. As gaming, my lord.
[731] [57] Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
[732] [15] Oph. My lord?
[733] [35] Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.  
[734] [22] Mar. Nor I, my lord.
[735] [22] Pol. Not I, my lord.
[736] [25] Ros. We shall, my lord.
[737] [24] Rey. I shall, my lord.
[738] [21] Hor. Well, my lord.
[739] [30] Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
[740] [21] Rey. Well, my lord.
[741] [26] Ham. Very well, my lord.
[742] [26] Hor. Very well, my lord.
[743] [32] Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.  
[744] [23] Rey. I will, my lord.
[745] [33] What does this mean, my lord?
[746] [34] Pol. What follows then, my lord?
[747] [33] Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.  
[748] [42] Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
[749] [26] Guil. Prison, my lord?  
[750] [38] Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
[751] [33] Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
[752] [37] Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
[753] [29] Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
[754] [19] Oph. No, my lord.
[755] [24] Hor. E'en so, my lord.
[756] [32] Ros. We think not so, my lord.
[757] [29] King. Thanks, dear my lord.
[758] [41] Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
[759] [24] Ros. Neither, my lord.
[760] [43] Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
[761] [35] Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
[762] [41] Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
[763] [54] Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
[764] [27] Queen. How fares my lord?
[765] [42] Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
[766] [24] Oph. What is, my lord?
[767] [34] Laer. What out of this, my lord?
[768] [32] Oph. What means this, my lord?
[769] [44] Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
[770] [26] Hor. What news, my lord?
[771] [35] Laer. What part is that, my lord?
[772] [28] Hor. What's that, my lord?
[773] [22] Guil. What, my lord?
[774] [25] Hor. It might, my lord.
[775] [40] Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
[776] [28] Hor. Remember it, my lord!
[777] [52] Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
[778] [29] Capt. I will do't, my lord.
[779] [23] Hor. Do not, my lord!
[780] [37] Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
[781] [23] Pol. Honest, my lord?
[782] [42] The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
[783] [50] Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
[784] [19] Oph. Ay, my lord.
[785] [19] Oph. Ay, my lord.
[786] [19] Laer. Ay my lord,
[787] [19] Hor. Ay, my lord.
[788] [23] 1. Play. Ay, my lord.
[789] [23] 1. Play. Ay, my lord.
[790] [19] Rey. Ay, my lord,
[791] [36] Guil. What should we say, my lord?
[792] [29] Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
[793] [30] Oph. You are merry, my lord.
[794] [44] Than is my deed to my most painted word.
[795] [35] Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
[796] [45] I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
[797] [45] So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
[798] [32] Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
[799] [42] The ratifiers and props of every word,
[800] [61] The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
[801] [54] Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
[802] [52] With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
[803] [53] But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
[804] [53] Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
[805] [38] Ghost. [beneath] Swear by his sword.
[806] [21] Ham. Upon my sword.
[807] [43] And lay your hands again upon my sword.
[808] [46] And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
[809] [22] Swear by my sword.
[810] [22] Swear by my sword.
[811] [44] Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
[812] [47] The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
[813] [45] As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
[814] [69] or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd  
[815] [37] King. Part them! They are incens'd.
[816] [46] Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
[817] [50] When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,  
[818] [51] And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
[819] [46] That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
[820] [45] But even then the morning cock crew loud,
[821] [40] And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
[822] [40] By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
[823] [50] It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
[824] [33] and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.
[825] [40] My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
[826] [42] But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
[827] [28] Laer. He is justly serv'd.
[828] [52] Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
[829] [30] Not shriving time allow'd.
[830] [31] city? Are they so follow'd?
[831] [21] Ham. Safely stow'd.
[832] [43] Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
[833] [68] fortunes turn Turk with me-with two Provincial roses on my raz'd
[834] [17] Dramatis Personae
[835] [45] Resembles that it was. What it should be,
[836] [69] Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
[837] [44] Till then in patience our proceeding be.
[838] [39] Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
[839] [69] Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
[840] [39] Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
[841] [42] A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
[842] [61] it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
[843] [39] what is't to leave betimes? Let be.
[844] [68] the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be
[845] [18] Queen. If it be,
[846] [44] To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
[847] [47] Unto that element; but long it could not be
[848] [39] But this eternal blazon must not be
[849] [48] 'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
[850] [68] vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be
[851] [44] But fill unshaken when they mellow be.
[852] [43] Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
[853] [50] Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
[854] [43] So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
[855] [52] This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
[856] [41] I have a voice and precedent of peace
[857] [43] For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
[858] [33] Ham. Then saw you not his face?
[859] [36] Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
[860] [39] He falls to such perusal of my face
[861] [48] Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
[862] [20] Get you a place.
[863] [50] As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
[864] [41] As he in his particular act and place
[865] [49] It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
[866] [31] Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
[867] [40] A double blessing is a double grace;
[868] [49] Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
[869] [49] Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
[870] [44] He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
[871] [43] But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
[872] [49] Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
[873] [44] If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
[874] [41] On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
[875] [48] Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
[876] [53] But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
[877] [48] A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
[878] [44] Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
[879] [47] Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
[880] [40] So, by my former lecture and advice,
[881] [49] Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
[882] [45] Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
[883] [37] To exploit now ripe in my device,
[884] [41] Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
[885] [64] on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.
[886] [17] O, vengeance!
[887] [50] You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
[888] [47] There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
[889] [56] Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
[890] [56] And that our drift look through our bad performance.
[891] [63] Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance
[892] [33] As fits a king's remembrance.
[893] [51] My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
[894] [46] Her brother is in secret come from France;
[895] [46] Your leave and favour to return to France;
[896] [52] Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
[897] [41] You do remember all the circumstance?
[898] [48] One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
[899] [47] King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
[900] [43] Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
[901] [52] More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
[902] [43] On such regards of safety and allowance
[903] [63] grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance
[904] [43] It will be laid to us, whose providence
[905] [12] defence?
[906] [41] For art and exercise in your defence,
[907] [42] But to confront the visage of offence?
[908] [47] May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
[909] [46] That both the world, I give to negligence,
[910] [56] For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
[911] [53] Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
[912] [55] And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
[913] [57] How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
[914] [59] Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
[915] [41] And call the noblest to the audience.
[916] [26] Sir, in this audience,
[917] [49] Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
[918] [51] We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
[919] [37] To offer it the show of violence;
[920] [41] Nor shall you do my ear that violence
[921] [42] pray You Pass with your best violence;
[922] [49] Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
[923] [44] That so his sickness, age, and impotence
[924] [43] He closes with you in this consequence:
[925] [44] Each small annexment, petty consequence,
[926] [40] Led by a delicate and tender prince,
[927] [58] Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
[928] [52] Importing health and graveness. Two months since
[929] [30] Ham. How long is that since?
[930] [63] Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
[931] [51] To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
[932] [57] but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
[933] [33] Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
[934] [45] It shall as level to your judgment pierce
[935] [48] And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
[936] [42] O, a Pit of clay for to be made  
[937] [43] [Sings] O, a pit of clay for to be made
[938] [48] The instant burst of clamour that she made
[939] [46] Till of this flat a mountain you have made
[940] [69] wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
[941] [48] The lists, and full proportions are all made
[942] [40] A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
[943] [31] And recks not his own rede.
[944] [47] Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
[945] [47] Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
[946] [52] Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
[947] [34] Guil. We will ourselves provide.
[948] [54] Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
[949] [52] Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
[950] [54] All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
[951] [53] Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
[952] [33] King. Let's follow, Gertrude.  
[953] [43] He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
[954] [49] Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
[955] [44] A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
[956] [40] I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
[957] [66] You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee
[958] [47] Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
[959] [57] And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
[960] [41] Why seems it so particular with thee?
[961] [48] For what advancement may I hope from thee,  
[962] [46] Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
[963] [50] Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
[964] [44] In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
[965] [42] But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
[966] [50] Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
[967] [28] Go on. I'll follow thee.
[968] [42] I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
[969] [45] And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
[970] [60] you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
[971] [46] O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
[972] [43] Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
[973] [63] work; but what o' that? Your Majesty, and we that have free
[974] [57] Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,  
[975] [66] Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
[976] [36] what part a gentleman would see.
[977] [60] your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see:
[978] [49] If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
[979] [42] An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
[980] [46] And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
[981] [38] For by the image of my cause I see
[982] [47] Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
[983] [50] T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
[984] [31] Hor. What is it you will see?
[985] [39] To keep those many many bodies safe
[986] [9] life,
[987] [46] In thee there is not half an hour of life.
[988] [40] That makes calamity of so long life.
[989] [56] guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.  
[990] [42] Upon whose property and most dear life
[991] [44] Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,
[992] [68] yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
[993] [45] Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
[994] [45] Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
[995] [48] The serpent that did sting thy father's life
[996] [41] Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
[997] [20] Pursued my life.
[998] [48] With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
[999] [41] Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
[1000] [42] To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
[1001] [51] Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
[1002] [39] If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
[1003] [69] shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
[1004] [53] You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
[1005] [53] I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
[1006] [44] Stood challenger on mount of all the age
[1007] [41] By heaven, it is as proper to our age
[1008] [44] You cannot call it love; for at your age
[1009] [24] And prey on garbage.
[1010] [54] With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
[1011] [50] His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
[1012] [44] When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
[1013] [51] Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
[1014] [42] Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
[1015] [53] 'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
[1016] [50] When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?  
[1017] [52] To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
[1018] [48] He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
[1019] [48] Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
[1020] [44] Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
[1021] [45] Ghost cries under the stage.
[1022] [46] Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage.
[1023] [51] King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
[1024] [43] Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
[1025] [56] Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
[1026] [30] The triumph of his pledge.
[1027] [47] And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
[1028] [43] We may of their encounter frankly judge
[1029] [50] Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
[1030] [52] The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
[1031] [29] Of the unworthiest siege.
[1032] [58] That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
[1033] [44] Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
[1034] [17] 'Tis strange.
[1035] [53] Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
[1036] [53] This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
[1037] [25] Ham. 'Tis very strange.
[1038] [56] Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
[1039] [23] bellow for revenge.
[1040] [58] Of your dear father's death, is't writ in Your revenge
[1041] [46] Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
[1042] [28] May sweep to my revenge.
[1043] [46] Witness this army of such mass and charge,
[1044] [53] Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
[1045] [48] When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
[1046] [44] And many such-like as's of great charge,
[1047] [7] he.
[1048] [20] Pol. What said he?
[1049] [66] earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he
[1050] [10] Ber. He.
[1051] [67] Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
[1052] [24] King. But where is he?
[1053] [67] Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
[1054] [24] King. But how hath she
[1055] [44] Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
[1056] [62] carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
[1057] [65] action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
[1058] [67] and we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
[1059] [64] [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
[1060] [63] thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
[1061] [66] Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
[1062] [60] Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
[1063] [67] Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
[1064] [68] Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
[1065] [67] temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
[1066] [65] put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
[1067] [67] Clown. Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the
[1068] [66] Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the
[1069] [64] Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
[1070] [69] is but variable service- two dishes, but to one table. That's the
[1071] [65] when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the
[1072] [66] Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
[1073] [61] of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
[1074] [64] ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
[1075] [69] seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
[1076] [49] And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
[1077] [48] A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
[1078] [54] Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
[1079] [45] Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
[1080] [50] With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
[1081] [43] And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
[1082] [69] article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
[1083] [42] When he himself might his quietus make
[1084] [69] him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
[1085] [47] Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
[1086] [34] These hands are not more like.
[1087] [63] tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like
[1088] [30] Queen. it may be, very like.
[1089] [42] That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
[1090] [53] The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
[1091] [28] King. The doors are broke.
[1092] [50] Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,  
[1093] [43] The need we have to use you did provoke
[1094] [38] Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
[1095] [23] Ham. Or like a whale.
[1096] [25] Pol. Very like a whale.
[1097] [51] Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
[1098] [22] Hor. Nay, very pale.
[1099] [43] 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
[1100] [39] For it is as the air, invulnerable,
[1101] [44] King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
[1102] [15] your table!
[1103] [50] King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
[1104] [44] How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
[1105] [40] Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
[1106] [47] Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
[1107] [21] Ham. Is't possible?
[1108] [21] Hor. Is't possible?
[1109] [53] Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
[1110] [49] The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
[1111] [13] My uncle?
[1112] [55] Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  
[1113] [53] Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.  
[1114] [52] I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
[1115] [42] Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
[1116] [41] Hor. Season your admiration for a while
[1117] [48] Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
[1118] [57] King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
[1119] [48] Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
[1120] [23] Ber. Sit down awhile,
[1121] [41] As to expend your time with us awhile
[1122] [51] Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
[1123] [37] Absent thee from felicity awhile,
[1124] [52] My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
[1125] [63] That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
[1126] [44] Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
[1127] [45] In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
[1128] [24] stopping a bunghole?
[1129] [53] When yond same star that's westward from the pole
[1130] [43] Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
[1131] [40] Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
[1132] [47] That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
[1133] [44] Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
[1134] [47] So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
[1135] [39] Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
[1136] [41] Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.
[1137] [34] Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.
[1138] [40] Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
[1139] [31] Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.
[1140] [29] Elsinore. hall in the Castle.
[1141] [31] Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
[1142] [31] Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
[1143] [21] A room in the Castle.
[1144] [31] Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
[1145] [31] Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
[1146] [31] Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
[1147] [37] Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.
[1148] [37] Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.
[1149] [54] Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
[1150] [36] They shall go far with little.  
[1151] [42] A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
[1152] [46] Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
[1153] [14] kill'd me.
[1154] [52] And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
[1155] [56] (Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!
[1156] [71] me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.  
[1157] [44] To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
[1158] [22] Can you advise me?
[1159] [50] Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
[1160] [68] you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
[1161] [37] Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
[1162] [31] Pol. What do you think of me?
[1163] [40] I am afeard You make a wanton of me.
[1164] [46] Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
[1165] [26] I pray you go with me.
[1166] [45] To punish me with this, and this with me,
[1167] [17] Ghost. Mark me.
[1168] [36] Laer. It well appears. But tell me
[1169] [55] King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
[1170] [32] Who is't that can inform me?
[1171] [45] And to the last bended their light on me.
[1172] [38] If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
[1173] [50] Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
[1174] [28] you cannot play upon me.
[1175] [50] This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
[1176] [30] What thou hast said to me.
[1177] [46] That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
[1178] [16] Speak to me.
[1179] [18] Speak to me.  
[1180] [27] Of his affection to me.
[1181] [47] Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
[1182] [21] His access to me.
[1183] [40] It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
[1184] [53] Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
[1185] [43] King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
[1186] [25] Laer. Come, one for me.
[1187] [50] Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
[1188] [38] Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
[1189] [29] Ham. She well instructs me.
[1190] [54] By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
[1191] [48] And do't the speedier that you may direct me
[1192] [63] Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
[1193] [67] pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
[1194] [54] King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
[1195] [28] Queen. Have you forgot me?
[1196] [65] Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
[1197] [47] To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
[1198] [32] In noise so rude against me?
[1199] [42] How all occasions do inform against me
[1200] [48] But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
[1201] [28] Will you be rul'd by me?
[1202] [48] Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
[1203] [40] And set a double varnish on the fame
[1204] [40] That for a fantasy and trick of fame
[1205] [49] And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame  
[1206] [52] Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
[1207] [39] Alack, and fie for shame!
[1208] [41] By Cock, they are to blame.
[1209] [51] I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.  
[1210] [39] O good Horatio, what a wounded name
[1211] [43] That hath in it no profit but the name.
[1212] [47] That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
[1213] [51] Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
[1214] [66] image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;
[1215] [46] Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
[1216] [22] King. The very same.
[1217] [45] To reason most absurd, whose common theme
[1218] [49] Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
[1219] [32] Queen. O my son, what theme?  
[1220] [51] Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
[1221] [44] So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
[1222] [52] For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
[1223] [47] Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
[1224] [48] My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
[1225] [21] take longer time.
[1226] [53] Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
[1227] [44] If his chief good and market of his time
[1228] [46] You must not take for fire. From this time
[1229] [47] To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
[1230] [42] But that I know love is begun by time,
[1231] [21] Ham. In happy time.
[1232] [41] All in the morning bedtime,
[1233] [19] To any pastime?
[1234] [9] Come.
[1235] [44] Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
[1236] [46] There with fantastic garlands did she come
[1237] [54] I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
[1238] [41] To let this canker of our nature come
[1239] [50] For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
[1240] [68] not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
[1241] [42] Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
[1242] [51] Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
[1243] [69] church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!
[1244] [40] That, if again this apparition come,
[1245] [46] Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
[1246] [48] Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
[1247] [32] Ghost. My hour is almost come,
[1248] [13] But come!
[1249] [34] Ham. He will stay till you come.
[1250] [51] For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
[1251] [68] Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
[1252] [23] Ham. You are welcome.
[1253] [51] Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
[1254] [47] Will return'd shall know you are come home.
[1255] [48] Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
[1256] [58] To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
[1257] [9] Rome-
[1258] [45] In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
[1259] [64] Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some
[1260] [43] I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
[1261] [53] Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
[1262] [32] Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
[1263] [42] You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
[1264] [41] Have by the very cunning of the scene
[1265] [70] tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene  
[1266] [46] Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
[1267] [67] his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
[1268] [48] Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
[1269] [50] And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-  
[1270] [51] King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
[1271] [57] King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
[1272] [44] I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
[1273] [45] I made to her in marriage, and to decline
[1274] [9] mine.
[1275] [21] To those of mine!
[1276] [46] And I do think- or else this brain of mine
[1277] [47] I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
[1278] [45] Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
[1279] [51] For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
[1280] [49] The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
[1281] [35] To be your Valentine.
[1282] [44] Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
[1283] [49] Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
[1284] [29] Ros. Then is the world one.
[1285] [30] The bell then beating one-
[1286] [11] Ham. One.
[1287] [28] From another one?
[1288] [50] And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
[1289] [43] To you yourself, to us, to every one.  
[1290] [21] ere you had done.
[1291] [43] Away! for everything is seal'd and done
[1292] [35] Laer. Must there no more be done?
[1293] [26] Priest. No more be done.
[1294] [48] Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
[1295] [42] If there be any good thing to be done,
[1296] [43] With sore distraction. What I have done
[1297] [49] Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
[1298] [49] And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
[1299] [35] Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
[1300] [43] Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
[1301] [34] He is dead and gone;
[1302] [47] Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
[1303] [52] Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
[1304] [34] He is gone, he is gone,
[1305] [17] Mar. 'Tis gone!
[1306] [49] Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
[1307] [21] Now I am alone.  
[1308] [44] Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
[1309] [46] And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
[1310] [17] To you alone.
[1311] [43] For nature crescent does not grow alone
[1312] [26] Other. Why, he had none.
[1313] [46] I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
[1314] [45] You are the most immediate to our throne,
[1315] [35] At his heels a stone.
[1316] [54] Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
[1317] [47] Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
[1318] [48] On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
[1319] [47] The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
[1320] [49] I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
[1321] [45] For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
[1322] [54] That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
[1323] [33] Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
[1324] [70] I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe  
[1325] [23] Ham. From top to toe?
[1326] [21] Laer. O, treble woe
[1327] [49] These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
[1328] [40] To be contracted in one brow of woe,
[1329] [47] Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
[1330] [68] be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
[1331] [52] I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
[1332] [44] Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
[1333] [37] Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
[1334] [67] Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
[1335] [50] To business with the King, more than the scope
[1336] [46] An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
[1337] [44] To desperation turn my trust and hope,
[1338] [42] For the supply and profit of our hope,
[1339] [22] Could not so mope.
[1340] [69] Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
[1341] [65] Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
[1342] [64] freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are
[1343] [64] me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are
[1344] [69] uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are
[1345] [48] To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
[1346] [22] by William Shakespeare
[1347] [20] Hor. Half a share.
[1348] [46] Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
[1349] [50] Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
[1350] [45] But to my mind, though I am native here  
[1351] [49] Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
[1352] [45] Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
[1353] [52] And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
[1354] [46] Is it not monstrous that this player here,
[1355] [29] Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
[1356] [17] Ber. 'Tis here!
[1357] [17] Hor. 'Tis here!
[1358] [45] Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
[1359] [44] That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
[1360] [52] That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,  
[1361] [44] That youth and observation copied there,
[1362] [49] Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
[1363] [32] Ham. Do you see nothing there?
[1364] [32] Ham. I would I had been there.
[1365] [46] It had been so with us, had we been there.
[1366] [49] or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.
[1367] [43] O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
[1368] [53] Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
[1369] [20] Ber. Who's there.?
[1370] [46] What is the issue of the business there.  
[1371] [66] Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits there;
[1372] [60] Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
[1373] [45] To England send him; or confine him where
[1374] [26] Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
[1375] [25] King. At supper? Where?
[1376] [68] and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
[1377] [49] Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
[1378] [60] To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
[1379] [48] Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
[1380] [41] 'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
[1381] [38] Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
[1382] [42] And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
[1383] [39] As if it some impartment did desire
[1384] [43] For every man hath business and desire,
[1385] [41] Out of the shot and danger of desire.
[1386] [40] It is most retrograde to our desire;
[1387] [45] Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
[1388] [41] Before You visit him, to make inquire
[1389] [45] O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
[1390] [55] Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.  
[1391] [48] And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
[1392] [34] Never departed more.
[1393] [47] would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
[1394] [46] To keep itself from noyance; but much more
[1395] [62] Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
[1396] [53] And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
[1397] [12] No more.
[1398] [41] 'One fair daughter, and no more,
[1399] [26] eyes. Prithee no more!
[1400] [32] Queen. O, speak to me no more!
[1401] [33] Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
[1402] [17] Queen. No more!
[1403] [25] Laer. Think it no more.
[1404] [47] Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
[1405] [54] And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
[1406] [41] Makes vow before his uncle never more
[1407] [69] Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
[1408] [13] Elsinore.
[1409] [17] SCENE.- Elsinore.
[1410] [40] But what is your affair in Elsinore?
[1411] [14] Near Elsinore.
[1412] [25] make you at Elsinore?
[1413] [22] Within the centre.
[1414] [42] The terms of our estate may not endure
[1415] [46] And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
[1416] [57] You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
[1417] [48] Well may it sort that this portentous figure
[1418] [41] Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
[1419] [56] Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
[1420] [69] Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
[1421] [54] Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
[1422] [42] Have you so slander any moment leisure
[1423] [38] Exposing what is mortal and unsure
[1424] [68] 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,
[1425] [50] For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
[1426] [48] Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
[1427] [50] Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
[1428] [49] Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
[1429] [33] Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
[1430] [41] So crimeful and so capital in nature,
[1431] [55] That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
[1432] [48] A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
[1433] [42] A violet in the youth of primy nature,
[1434] [69] Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
[1435] [35] Among a mineral of metals base,
[1436] [49] Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
[1437] [48] We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
[1438] [42] But, like the owner of a foul disease,
[1439] [13] phrase.
[1440] [50] They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
[1441] [46] Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
[1442] [49] Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
[1443] [40] Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
[1444] [46] Last, and as such containing as all these,
[1445] [48] Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
[1446] [54] Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,
[1447] [55] Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
[1448] [41] For food and diet, to some enterprise
[1449] [47] Through your dominions for this enterprise,
[1450] [50] For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
[1451] [30] When it prov'd otherwise.?
[1452] [19] be otherwise.
[1453] [45] (As how should it be so? how otherwise?),
[1454] [66] true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
[1455] [69] half a year. But, by'r Lady, he must build churches then; or else
[1456] [47] As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
[1457] [52] Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
[1458] [27] Laer. What ceremony else?
[1459] [27] Laer. What ceremony else?
[1460] [10] sense.
[1461] [50] As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
[1462] [42] Or but a sickly part of one true sense
[1463] [42] As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
[1464] [46] Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
[1465] [55] Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
[1466] [47] That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
[1467] [53] Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
[1468] [66] in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
[1469] [66] shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose  
[1470] [65] end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
[1471] [48] The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
[1472] [45] And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
[1473] [46] Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
[1474] [49] How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
[1475] [46] What to ourselves in passion we propose,
[1476] [46] Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
[1477] [66] brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,
[1478] [46] Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
[1479] [45] Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
[1480] [48] And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
[1481] [50] When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
[1482] [31] Oph. Still better, and worse.
[1483] [40] In obstinate condolement is a course
[1484] [67] thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
[1485] [50] And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
[1486] [51] Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
[1487] [41] I had my father's signet in my purse,
[1488] [49] Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
[1489] [45] Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
[1490] [45] For this effect defective comes by cause.
[1491] [49] Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,  
[1492] [46] That your good beauties be the happy cause
[1493] [53] Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
[1494] [67] sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
[1495] [44] That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
[1496] [43] To tell the secrets of my prison house,
[1497] [51] Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
[1498] [55] Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
[1499] [51] There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
[1500] [44] If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
[1501] [62] Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
[1502] [45] But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
[1503] [52] What, have you given him any hard words of late?
[1504] [41] 'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
[1505] [49] And our affairs from England come too late.  
[1506] [55] King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
[1507] [39] My liege, and madam, to expostulate
[1508] [42] Set your entreatments at a higher rate
[1509] [41] Let me be no assistant for a state,  
[1510] [49] Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
[1511] [46] The safety and health of this whole state,
[1512] [22] Of his true state.
[1513] [51] So far from cheer and from your former state.
[1514] [46] Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
[1515] [50] This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
[1516] [42] As it doth well appear unto our state,
[1517] [44] Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
[1518] [44] The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
[1519] [47] As of a father; for let the world take note
[1520] [46] As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
[1521] [41] Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
[1522] [31] Th' effect of what I wrote?
[1523] [48] The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
[1524] [55] That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
[1525] [48] Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
[1526] [50] What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
[1527] [44] For the demand of our neglected tribute.
[1528] [41] The pith and marrow of our attribute.
[1529] [43] The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
[1530] [49] Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
[1531] [52] Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
[1532] [53] Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
[1533] [43] Give it an understanding but no tongue.
[1534] [57] Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
[1535] [50] But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
[1536] [37] Enter Prologue.
[1537] [46] This above all- to thine own self be true,
[1538] [33] King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
[1539] [51] Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
[1540] [22] Pol. 'Tis most true;
[1541] [47] Collected from all simples that have virtue
[1542] [53] To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;  
[1543] [40] Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
[1544] [47] I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
[1545] [33] Laer. I pray you give me leave.
[1546] [65] By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
[1547] [52] Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
[1548] [68] Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
[1549] [29] Queen. What would she have?
[1550] [47] And makes us rather bear those ills we have
[1551] [23] Rey. My lord, I have.
[1552] [54] Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
[1553] [68] first mouth'd, to be last Swallowed. When he needs what you have
[1554] [62] this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have
[1555] [44] Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
[1556] [29] But he's an arrant knave.
[1557] [46] Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
[1558] [64] grave.]
[1559] [57] Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
[1560] [64] Leaps in the grave.
[1561] [44] To outface me with leaping in her grave?
[1562] [51] Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
[1563] [35] And not have strew'd thy grave.
[1564] [21] Ham. Into my grave?
[1565] [45] Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
[1566] [46] Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
[1567] [69] reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
[1568] [42] Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
[1569] [26] pound! Didst perceive?
[1570] [64] those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
[1571] [51] They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
[1572] [65] beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
[1573] [44] And thy commandment all alone shall live
[1574] [23] Ham. Nay, but to live
[1575] [53] bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
[1576] [49] Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
[1577] [53] Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
[1578] [44] I could not but by her. The other motive
[1579] [48] Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
[1580] [34] Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
[1581] [44] Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
[1582] [39] Anon, as patient as the female dove
[1583] [27] Fare you well, my dove!
[1584] [50] To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
[1585] [42] In youth when I did love, did love,
[1586] [45] I do receive your offer'd love like love,
[1587] [54] Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
[1588] [45] There lives within the very flame of love
[1589] [52] Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
[1590] [42] As meditation or the thoughts of love,
[1591] [37] This is the very ecstasy of love,
[1592] [37] And with no less nobility of love
[1593] [47] Could not (with all their quantity of love)
[1594] [50] Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
[1595] [47] Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
[1596] [35] But never doubt I love.
[1597] [44] If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
[1598] [47] More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
[1599] [48] This mad young man. But so much was our love
[1600] [13] his love.
[1601] [22] Receiv'd his love?
[1602] [23] Ham. As woman's love.
[1603] [47] From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
[1604] [64] Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
[1605] [26] Pol. Mad for thy love?  
[1606] [50] Queen. The instances that second marriage move
[1607] [41] Doubt that the sun doth move;
[1608] [40] Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
[1609] [59] This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
[1610] [47] For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
[1611] [40] As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
[1612] [31] Guil. Faith, her privates we.
[1613] [44] After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
[1614] [50] O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
[1615] [43] No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
[1616] [29] Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
[1617] [42] No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
[1618] [46] Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
[1619] [43] With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
[1620] [48] He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
[1621] [45] Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,

[1623] [46] Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
[1624] [41] We shall express our duty in his eye;
[1625] [40] And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
[1626] [50] I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
[1627] [51] King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
[1628] [60] Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.  
[1629] [68] hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief
[1630] [47] Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief  
[1631] [52] Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
[1632] [48] King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
[1633] [44] The origin and commencement of his grief
[1634] [48] Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
[1635] [37] By his cockle bat and' staff
[1636] [42] Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
[1637] [33] My head should be struck off.
[1638] [65] A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
[1639] [51] Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.
[1640] [50] Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
[1641] [66] are shot off.  
[1642] [12] not off.
[1643] [38] If it be made of penetrable stuff;
[1644] [69] sir,- it comes from th' ambassador that was bound for England- if

[1654] [45] I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
[1655] [50] Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
[1656] [45] Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
[1657] [47] Given private time to you, and you yourself
[1658] [45] And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
[1659] [45] It sends some precious instance of itself

[1661] [39] Being a thing immortal as itself?  
[1662] [43] Whose violent property fordoes itself  
[1663] [52] With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
[1664] [30] Hor. As thou art to thyself.

[1667] [45] Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,

[1671] [36] Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
[1672] [36] That to Laertes I forgot myself,

[1675] [65] very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of

[1677] [67] his wife, Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece of
[1678] [67] Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
[1679] [67] fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of

[1681] [67] letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of

[1699] [42] Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
[1700] [63] Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
[1701] [60] Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
[1702] [46] I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
[1703] [46] What company, at what expense; and finding
[1704] [65] Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
[1705] [62] neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
[1706] [50] Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
[1707] [24] The King is a thing-
[1708] [49] More relative than this. The play's the thing

[1714] [18] Did nothing.
[1715] [15] Ham. Nothing.
[1716] [27] Ber. I have seen nothing.
[1717] [51] With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
[1718] [53] That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
[1719] [51] As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
[1720] [43] There's such divinity doth hedge a king
[1721] [14] of a king?
[1722] [24] Queen. As kill a king?
[1723] [44] And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
[1724] [48] They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
[1725] [13] the King.
[1726] [51] Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
[1727] [31] Mar. Is it not like the King?
[1728] [45] There is a play to-night before the King.
[1729] [26] Ber. Long live the King!
[1730] [49] Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
[1731] [44] Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
[1732] [48] To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
[1733] [45] This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
[1734] [51] But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-
[1735] [64] Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
[1736] [39] Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
[1737] [21] O thou vile king,
[1738] [50] For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
[1739] [64] Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
[1740] [11] Enter King.
[1741] [31] Enter King.
[1742] [42] 'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
[1743] [43] Both to my God and to my gracious king;
[1744] [60] Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
[1745] [49] At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
[1746] [46] Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
[1747] [45] Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
[1748] [17] grave-making?
[1749] [34] This man shall set me packing.
[1750] [53] As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
[1751] [47] That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
[1752] [65] That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
[1753] [55] Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
[1754] [28] When thou liest howling.
[1755] [30] In censure of his seeming.
[1756] [68] Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.
[1757] [38] Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
[1758] [45] Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
[1759] [69] shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing
[1760] [64] Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
[1761] [34] His silence will sit drooping.
[1762] [49] A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
[1763] [49] Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
[1764] [54] The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
[1765] [50] Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
[1766] [67] light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
[1767] [46] The canker galls the infants of the spring
[1768] [29] Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
[1769] [49] Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
[1770] [52] Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
[1771] [50] A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
[1772] [47] Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
[1773] [46] And sure I am two men there are not living
[1774] [48] Most generous, and free from all contriving,
[1775] [45] When I had seen this hot love on the wing
[1776] [70] nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,  
[1777] [54] If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
[1778] [48] Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
[1779] [25] the puppets dallying.
[1780] [24] Pol. This is too long.
[1781] [47] The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
[1782] [46] Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
[1783] [43] Therefore I have entreated him along,  
[1784] [55] Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
[1785] [50] Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
[1786] [45] Believe so much in him, that he is young,
[1787] [16] are unwrung.
[1788] [49] But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
[1789] [42] In going back to school in Wittenberg,
[1790] [51] I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
[1791] [66] Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
[1792] [43] Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
[1793] [25] Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
[1794] [58] will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?
[1795] [42] And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
[1796] [50] And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
[1797] [41] Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
[1798] [53] taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
[1799] [69] [To Laertes] Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech.
[1800] [67] plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
[1801] [66] his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
[1802] [48] My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
[1803] [49] I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
[1804] [69] assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French
[1805] [55] I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
[1806] [62] against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French

[1808] [45] Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
[1809] [45] Appears before them and with solemn march
[1810] [44] And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
[1811] [40] Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
[1812] [44] Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
[1813] [46] I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
[1814] [51] And I with them the third night kept the watch;
[1815] [43] (Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch
[1816] [49] With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
[1817] [49] Why this same strict and most observant watch
[1818] [40] Hath clawed me in his clutch,
[1819] [47] A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
[1820] [51] You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
[1821] [47] The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
[1822] [40] Without the sensible and true avouch
[1823] [39] As if I had never been such.
[1824] [69] Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
[1825] [54] And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
[1826] [67] form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though
[1827] [40] The chariest maid is prodigal enough
[1828] [49] That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
[1829] [67] Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
[1830] [45] For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
[1831] [50] Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
[1832] [44] And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
[1833] [61] Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
[1834] [54] As love between them like the palm might flourish,
[1835] [41] And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
[1836] [52] Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
[1837] [46] We'll put the matter to the present push.-
[1838] [68] Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
[1839] [66] Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
[1840] [50] Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
[1841] [20] It may be death.
[1842] [49] Under the moon, can save the thing from death
[1843] [46] He should the bearers put to sudden death,
[1844] [46] Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
[1845] [57] (For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death),
[1846] [48] But that the dread of something after death-
[1847] [46] He never gave commandment for their death.
[1848] [45] O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
[1849] [47] That I am guiltless of your father's death,
[1850] [50] With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
[1851] [51] Which I have told thee, of my father's death.  
[1852] [48] Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
[1853] [53] King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
[1854] [49] Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,

[1857] [30] And hears it roar beneath.
[1858] [43] Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
[1859] [53] Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
[1860] [39] Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
[1861] [51] The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
[1862] [16] rawer breath
[1863] [64] Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
[1864] [65] yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath
[1865] [67] his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
[1866] [48] That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
[1867] [57] Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
[1868] [32] Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
[1869] [16] Hor. In faith,
[1870] [51] Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
[1871] [68] tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with

[1879] [47] King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
[1880] [41] I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
[1881] [64] thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth
[1882] [49] Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
[1883] [66] heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
[1884] [48] Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
[1885] [42] Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
[1886] [69] Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
[1887] [29] Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
[1888] [52] The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
[1889] [52] Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
[1890] [49] 'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
[1891] [43] For he himself is subject to his birth.
[1892] [47] To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
[1893] [53] I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth

[1899] [46] Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
[1900] [42] King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
[1901] [43] And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
[1902] [50] That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
[1903] [46] What is between you? Give me up the truth.
[1904] [52] Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
[1905] [38] Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
[1906] [43] How much I had to do to calm his rage I
[1907] [58] Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I

[1917] [67] Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I  
[1918] [44] Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
[1919] [42] O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
[1920] [50] Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
[1921] [18] Hor. That can I.
[1922] [66] pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in, I

[1925] [67] not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I

[1927] [43] Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
[1928] [46] As I do thee. Something too much of this I
[1929] [70] Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I  
[1930] [65] Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
[1931] [67] o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
[1932] [10] Yet I,
[1933] [19] My lord, not I.

[1951] [55] Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
[1952] [53] For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
[1953] [56] Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
[1954] [13] O, speak!
[1955] [48] Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
[1956] [50] But from what cause he will by no means speak.
[1957] [44] And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,

[1978] [45] Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
[1979] [45] And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
[1980] [66] Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk
[1981] [42] As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
[1982] [40] I bought an unction of a mountebank,
[1983] [40] As level as the cannon to his blank,
[1984] [50] What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
[1985] [51] Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
[1986] [46] Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
[1987] [33] Your wisdom best shall think.
[1988] [64] breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think
[1989] [58] King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
[1990] [57] Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,  
[1991] [51] Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
[1992] [31] King. Gertrude, do not drink.
[1993] [49] Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.
[1994] [43] If I had play'd the desk or table book,
[1995] [62] We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
[1996] [67] The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
[1997] [48] Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
[1998] [48] Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
[1999] [41] And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
[2000] [45] My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
[2001] [30] Couch we awhile, and mark.
[2002] [40] Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
[2003] [29] A very noble youth. Mark.

[2005] [35] Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.
[2006] [42] In which the majesty of buried Denmark
[2007] [40] THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK
[2008] [51] Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[2009] [28] Claudius, King of Denmark.
[2010] [51] A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
[2011] [49] Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
[2012] [53] Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
[2013] [35] for your succession in Denmark?
[2014] [52] And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
[2015] [50] From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
[2016] [54] Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
[2017] [60] How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
[2018] [50] What might you think? No, I went round to work
[2019] [43] And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
[2020] [43] Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
[2021] [52] Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
[2022] [40] We do it wrong, being so majestical,
[2023] [68] air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
[2024] [63] Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
[2025] [53] King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
[2026] [44] which was the model of that Danish seal;
[2027] [44] Where every god did seem to set his seal
[2028] [43] (My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
[2029] [41] As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
[2030] [47] Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
[2031] [65] laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
[2032] [63] Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
[2033] [23] Of bell and burial.
[2034] [69] gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
[2035] [64] The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
[2036] [42] With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
[2037] [34] Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
[2038] [44] His means of death, his obscure funeral-
[2039] [52] Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

[2041] [47] But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
[2042] [35] Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
[2043] [50] Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
[2044] [48] Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
[2045] [54] Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
[2046] [48] What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
[2047] [51] That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
[2048] [57] Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
[2049] [51] Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
[2050] [65] Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
[2051] [30] And bear it to the chapel.
[2052] [38] With variable objects, shall expel

[2054] [34] Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
[2055] [36] Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
[2056] [69] Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
[2057] [65] memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.
[2058] [47] The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
[2059] [48] From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
[2060] [47] When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
[2061] [16] into a toil?
[2062] [43] Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil

[2064] [52] To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
[2065] [62] not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
[2066] [25] Ber. Last night of all,
[2067] [21] they'll tell all.
[2068] [45] Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
[2069] [42] His liberty is full of threats to all-
[2070] [43] The better to beguile. This is for all:
[2071] [68] do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
[2072] [50] Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
[2073] [50] Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
[2074] [45] And so, without more circumstance at all,
[2075] [49] (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
[2076] [18] Or not at all.
[2077] [42] Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
[2078] [45] And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
[2079] [64] the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call
[2080] [49] May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
[2081] [52] And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
[2082] [44] To be forestalled ere we come to fall,  
[2083] [45] And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
[2084] [49] Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
[2085] [41] But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
[2086] [47] And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
[2087] [67] target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
[2088] [51] That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
[2089] [21] King. So you shall;
[2090] [65] Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall

[2092] [43] A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
[2093] [46] Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
[2094] [40] As if he had been loosed out of hell
[2095] [57] Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
[2096] [49] O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
[2097] [50] But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
[2098] [31] Other. Marry, now I can tell!
[2099] [29] Other. Mass, I cannot tell.
[2100] [43] Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
[2101] [35] Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
[2102] [44] The which he loved passing well.'
[2103] [22] love passing well.
[2104] [44] Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
[2105] [47] And for my means, I'll husband them so well
[2106] [44] Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
[2107] [43] I will bestow him, and will answer well
[2108] [67] Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well.
[2109] [25] King. It likes us well;
[2110] [44] Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
[2111] [49] My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
[2112] [29] Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
[2113] [54] Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
[2114] [43] Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
[2115] [33] Ham. I am glad to see you well.
[2116] [49] I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
[2117] [33] Queen. Did he receive you well?
[2118] [13] Farewell.
[2119] [46] Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
[2120] [60] for England. Of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
[2121] [41] nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
[2122] [50] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
[2123] [16] Pol. Farewell!
[2124] [39] Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
[2125] [44] Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
[2126] [47] King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
[2127] [67] The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
[2128] [32] King. Let him demand his fill.
[2129] [49] Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
[2130] [41] New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
[2131] [42] We must with all our majesty and skill
[2132] [23] have not the skill.
[2133] [53] A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
[2134] [44] Let it be tenable in your silence still;
[2135] [25] Ham. It waves me still.
[2136] [44] And nothing is at a like goodness still;
[2137] [68] Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that 'a will
[2138] [43] To show us so much gentry and good will
[2139] [43] No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
[2140] [65] Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
[2141] [35] Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
[2142] [24] All. We will, we will!
[2143] [31] Rough-hew them how we will-
[2144] [14] Ham. I will.
[2145] [43] Though inclination be as sharp as will.
[2146] [67] of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
[2147] [28] And reason panders will.
[2148] [67] Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
[2149] [67] fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
[2150] [25] Hor. I warr'nt it will.
[2151] [53] Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
[2152] [69] know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
[2153] [45] And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
[2154] [33] All flaxen was his poll.
[2155] [46] That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
[2156] [40] Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
[2157] [49] Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
[2158] [64] [Throws up a skull.]
[2159] [64] [Puts down the skull.]
[2160] [64] Throws up [another skull].
[2161] [47] Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  
[2162] [64] Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
[2163] [52] Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
[2164] [20] Mar. O, wonderful!
[2165] [48] As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
[2166] [35] And my imaginations are as foul
[2167] [27] Ham. O my prophetic soul!
[2168] [43] The inward service of the mind and soul
[2169] [44] She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
[2170] [47] When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
[2171] [45] O, step between her and her fighting soul
[2172] [46] And we shall jointly labour with your soul
[2173] [48] Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
[2174] [43] To take him in the purging of his soul,
[2175] [55] Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
[2176] [34] God 'a'mercy on his soul!
[2177] [32] Laer. The devil take thy soul!
[2178] [42] Even with the very comment of thy soul
[2179] [37] I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
[2180] [45] Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
[2181] [18] Ham. Good madam!
[2182] [46] Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
[2183] [50] the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
[2184] [52] That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
[2185] [25] Now falls on Priam.
[2186] [49] 'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
[2187] [42] This sudden sending him away must seem
[2188] [67] entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them
[2189] [57] Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
[2190] [35] And not where I had aim'd them.
[2191] [52] You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
[2192] [51] They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
[2193] [33] I pray you, now receive them.
[2194] [65] speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
[2195] [55] But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
[2196] [49] Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
[2197] [24] help to hasten them?
[2198] [50] That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
[2199] [37] King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
[2200] [38] King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
[2201] [29] Of him that brought them.
[2202] [68] are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
[2203] [53] And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
[2204] [51] We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
[2205] [54] (For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)
[2206] [55] And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
[2207] [34] This night to play before him.
[2208] [38] Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
[2209] [25] Hor. Heaven secure him!
[2210] [32] Hor. I did very well note him.
[2211] [44] And will not let belief take hold of him
[2212] [22] Hor. A piece of him.
[2213] [55] Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
[2214] [28] Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
[2215] [51] Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
[2216] [49] To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
[2217] [31] Pray you be round with him.
[2218] [54] That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
[2219] [64] [Grapples with him].
[2220] [44] No more to undertake it, I will work him
[2221] [67] him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
[2222] [29] We cannot get from him.  
[2223] [45] Did not together pluck such envy from him
[2224] [69] Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
[2225] [47] Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
[2226] [43] That we with wisest sorrow think on him
[2227] [46] And thus a while the fit will work on him.
[2228] [44] You must not put another scandal on him,
[2229] [45] Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
[2230] [46] Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
[2231] [49] King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
[2232] [55] Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
[2233] [47] This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
[2234] [32] Pleasant and helpful to him!
[2235] [52] Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
[2236] [69] 'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
[2237] [50] Is the great love the general gender bear him,
[2238] [38] Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
[2239] [52] That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
[2240] [49] To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
[2241] [25] Speak loudly for him.
[2242] [41] Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
[2243] [30] 1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,
[2244] [50] at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].
[2245] [48] Let his queen mother all alone entreat him  
[2246] [32] King. Well, we shall sift him.
[2247] [56] More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
[2248] [70] Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,  
[2249] [29] Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
[2250] [28] Queen. Did you assay him  
[2251] [24] Queen. But not by him!
[2252] [51] Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
[2253] [54] To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
[2254] [48] I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
[2255] [56] A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
[2256] [46] With tristful visage, as against the doom,
[2257] [47] I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
[2258] [43] The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
[2259] [42] And to the manner born, it is a custom
[2260] [22] Hor. Is it a custom?
[2261] [42] At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
[2262] [46] Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
[2263] [50] No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
[2264] [47] And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
[2265] [38] In filial obligation for some term
[2266] [44] Together with that fair and warlike form
[2267] [46] And there assume some other, horrible form
[2268] [47] The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
[2269] [64] act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;
[2270] [63] Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
[2271] [47] But, as we often see, against some storm,
[2272] [43] of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
[2273] [54] Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
[2274] [56] Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
[2275] [68] the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and an
[2276] [65] escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
[2277] [67] honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
[2278] [46] And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
[2279] [45] So much as from occasion you may glean,  
[2280] [47] To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
[2281] [30] That I might be the organ.
[2282] [66] did the first murther! This might be the pate of a Politician,
[2283] [41] To give the world assurance of a man.
[2284] [44] And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
[2285] [23] Ham. As th'art a man,
[2286] [45] Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
[2287] [43] Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
[2288] [28] The unseen good old man.
[2289] [44] Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
[2290] [42] For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
[2291] [66] Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
[2292] [42] Holds such an enmity with blood of man
[2293] [15] Speak, man.
[2294] [51] To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
[2295] [44] Thou canst not then be false to any man.
[2296] [15] gentleman.'
[2297] [38] Enter Horatio, Queen, and a Gentleman.
[2298] [28] Other. Was he a gentleman?
[2299] [29] Ros. Most like a gentleman.
[2300] [41] But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
[2301] [42] He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
[2302] [67] newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,
[2303] [43] Like a good child and a true gentleman.
[2304] [51] 'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
[2305] [52] Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
[2306] [64] [Exit Gentleman.]
[2307] [34] would perhaps trouble a woman.
[2308] [68] is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman
[2309] [55] Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
[2310] [28] O most pernicious woman!
[2311] [17] King. A Norman.
[2312] [33] And we cast away moan.
[2313] [48] Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
[2314] [45] Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
[2315] [46] Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
[2316] [54] About the world have times twelve thirties been,

[2318] [48] And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
[2319] [43] Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
[2320] [43] It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
[2321] [49] I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
[2322] [33] What we two nights have seen.
[2323] [49] Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
[2324] [49] Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
[2325] [26] Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
[2326] [55] 1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'
[2327] [67] have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen
[2328] [54] Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.  
[2329] [44] This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
[2330] [26] Ham. How does the Queen?
[2331] [39] Enter Queen.
[2332] [49] Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
[2333] [47] The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
[2334] [25] How now, sweet queen?
[2335] [64] [Exit Queen.]
[2336] [46] My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
[2337] [55] And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
[2338] [69] will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
[2339] [63] Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
[2340] [49] When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
[2341] [71] carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.  
[2342] [32] King. Will you know them then?
[2343] [23] Ham. What woman then?
[2344] [50] But if the gods themselves did see her then,
[2345] [38] Be you and I behind an arras then.
[2346] [20] O heavy burthen!
[2347] [69] your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now. This skull hath lien
[2348] [49] And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
[2349] [68] Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
[2350] [45] The imminent death of twenty thousand men
[2351] [48] The form of plausive manners, that these men
[2352] [39] So oft it chances in particular men
[2353] [17] the only men.
[2354] [18] Queen. Ay, amen!
[2355] [44] Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
[2356] [46] Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
[2357] [40] Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
[2358] [17] All. Gentlemen!
[2359] [51] Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
[2360] [27] Come hither, gentlemen,
[2361] [64] Exeunt Gentlemen.
[2362] [35] Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
[2363] [38] Unto our climature and countrymen.
[2364] [52] Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
[2365] [31] On plots and errors happen.
[2366] [65] that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
[2367] [64] Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
[2368] [68] suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
[2369] [52] And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
[2370] [50] Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
[2371] [54] And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
[2372] [48] That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
[2373] [54] Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
[2374] [44] With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
[2375] [53] Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
[2376] [44] Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
[2377] [14] To heaven.
[2378] [47] Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
[2379] [50] Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
[2380] [48] And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
[2381] [47] O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
[2382] [45] It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
[2383] [50] Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
[2384] [47] Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
[2385] [38] As oft as any passion under heaven
[2386] [53] Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
[2387] [33] Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
[2388] [46] Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
[2389] [55] But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
[2390] [44] Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
[2391] [69] receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
[2392] [66] his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in
[2393] [66] Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
[2394] [63] faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in
[2395] [64] valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in
[2396] [24] Hor. Let them come in.
[2397] [27] Queen. Let her come in.  
[2398] [64] A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
[2399] [25] All. No, let's come in!
[2400] [68] twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
[2401] [64] piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in
[2402] [66] especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in
[2403] [43] Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
[2404] [64] [Exit the Queen. Then] Exit Hamlet, tugging in
[2405] [23] Is very cunning in.
[2406] [59] Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
[2407] [30] your bounty. Take them in.
[2408] [52] King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
[2409] [65] Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
[2410] [66] Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
[2411] [69] Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
[2412] [67] honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in
[2413] [10] again.
[2414] [41] I shall not look upon his like again.
[2415] [34] He never will come again.
[2416] [36] And will he not come again?
[2417] [36] And will he not come again?
[2418] [46] Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
[2419] [32] Perchance 'twill walk again.
[2420] [20] Laer. Well, again!
[2421] [56] Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
[2422] [47] But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
[2423] [54] And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
[2424] [45] Now fear I this will give it start again;
[2425] [40] Enter Ghost again.
[2426] [40] Would have reverted to my bow again,
[2427] [43] Will bring him to his wonted way again,
[2428] [33] Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
[2429] [52] That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
[2430] [48] O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
[2431] [58] Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
[2432] [50] With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
[2433] [29] Polonius, Lord Chamberlain.
[2434] [30] Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
[2435] [46] That he which hath your noble father slain
[2436] [47] But in battalions! First, her father slain;
[2437] [42] Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
[2438] [51] Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
[2439] [45] Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
[2440] [42] And we beseech you, bend you to remain
[2441] [52] And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
[2442] [48] Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
[2443] [34] Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,  
[2444] [43] Within the book and volume of my brain,
[2445] [41] Without more motive, into every brain
[2446] [64] Exeunt [all but the Captain].
[2447] [22] A Norwegian Captain.
[2448] [58] Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
[2449] [28] Hor. That is most certain.
[2450] [48] Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
[2451] [53] Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
[2452] [48] And never come mischance between us twain!
[2453] [24] Ham. Up from my cabin,
[2454] [43] To his confine; and of the truth herein
[2455] [49] 'Now the King drinks to Hamlet.' Come, begin.
[2456] [44] And, as the world were now but to begin,
[2457] [47] I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
[2458] [43] Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
[2459] [64] A noise within.
[2460] [64] Give, me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
[2461] [64] [Drum; trumpets sound; a piece goes off [within].
[2462] [64] [March within.]
[2463] [46] Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
[2464] [64] To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
[2465] [49] Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
[2466] [45] And after we will both our judgments join
[2467] [43] Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
[2468] [26] King. Our son shall win.
[2469] [33] How now O What hath befall'n?
[2470] [38] Such was the very armour he had on
[2471] [39] I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
[2472] [31] Give us the foils. Come on.
[2473] [39] And prologue to the omen coming on,
[2474] [38] To put an antic disposition on),  
[2475] [42] For he was likely, had he been put on,
[2476] [66] Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
[2477] [20] For. Go softly on.
[2478] [51] And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
[2479] [45] And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
[2480] [26] In honourable fashion.
[2481] [17] A scullion!  
[2482] [46] But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
[2483] [48] Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
[2484] [51] Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
[2485] [44] But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
[2486] [28] Into a tow'ring passion.
[2487] [45] Had he the motive and the cue for passion
[2488] [33] against their own succession.
[2489] [49] When we would bring him on to some confession
[2490] [30] hold up Adam's profession.
[2491] [47] Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
[2492] [54] I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
[2493] [39] This present object made probation.
[2494] [48] That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  
[2495] [69] Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
[2496] [30] And gem of all the nation.
[2497] [56] If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
[2498] [43] Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
[2499] [33] I have in quick determination
[2500] [41] To show my duty in your coronation,  
[2501] [44] The very place puts toys of desperation,
[2502] [29] amazement and admiration.
[2503] [39] Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
[2504] [42] No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
[2505] [51] And they in France of the best rank and station
[2506] [62] him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
[2507] [28] seeks her own salvation?
[2508] [15] innovation.
[2509] [38] Mar. Look with what courteous action
[2510] [51] Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
[2511] [49] And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
[2512] [46] And could of men distinguish, her election
[2513] [16] discretion.
[2514] [43] According to the phrase or the addition
[2515] [45] Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
[2516] [43] Why should we in our peevish opposition
[2517] [40] So horridly to shake our disposition
[2518] [49] Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
[2519] [49] That might your nature, honour, and exception
[2520] [48] Shall in the general censure take corruption
[2521] [34] went to cuffs in the question.
[2522] [49] Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
[2523] [47] By this encompassment and drift of question
[2524] [35] That I must call't in question.
[2525] [49] But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
[2526] [41] And thus the native hue of resolution
[2527] [68] about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,
[2528] [41] By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
[2529] [68] Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
[2530] [46] For what we know must be, and is as common
[2531] [31] Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
[2532] [44] And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
[2533] [32] And his sandal shoon.
[2534] [48] Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
[2535] [43] Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
[2536] [41] If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
[2537] [38] My custom always of the afternoon,
[2538] [66] Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
[2539] [25] Ham. What's his weapon?
[2540] [46] Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
[2541] [53] Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
[2542] [68] demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son
[2543] [44] Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
[2544] [47] Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
[2545] [49] Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
[2546] [22] Where is your son?
[2547] [48] Than that which dearest father bears his son
[2548] [42] But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
[2549] [45] You laying these slight sullies on my son
[2550] [38] That capability and godlike reason
[2551] [50] (O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason
[2552] [52] Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
[2553] [50] Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
[2554] [49] Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
[2555] [25] fay, I cannot reason.
[2556] [24] All. Treason! treason!
[2557] [60] Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
[2558] [58] or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
[2559] [26] Ham. Denmark's a prison.
[2560] [65] deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
[2561] [51] Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.  
[2562] [45] Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
[2563] [48] On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
[2564] [42] Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
[2565] [56] Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[2566] [51] King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[2567] [55] Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[2568] [51] Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[2569] [48] Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[2570] [50] Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[2571] [58] Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.
[2572] [64] [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
[2573] [64] Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[2574] [64] [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
[2575] [64] Exeunt [Rosencrantz and Guildenstern].
[2576] [64] Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
[2577] [52] King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
[2578] [50] Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
[2579] [46] The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
[2580] [45] Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
[2581] [46] The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
[2582] [50] himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.
[2583] [50] occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
[2584] [64] your mother's commandment; if not, your pardon and my return
[2585] [42] But, orderly to end where I begun,  
[2586] [44] Our wills and fates do so contrary run
[2587] [49] Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
[2588] [48] 'So would I 'a' done, by yonder sun,
[2589] [63] Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own
[2590] [56] Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
[2591] [68] desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own  
[2592] [51] His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
[2593] [48] And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
[2594] [62] Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and down
[2595] [43] They had begun the play. I sat me down;
[2596] [53] Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
[2597] [25] Hor. Well, sit we down,
[2598] [51] Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
[2599] [51] And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
[2600] [33] And break your own neck down.
[2601] [28] As therein are set down.
[2602] [39] My tables! Meet it is I set it down
[2603] [53] Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down
[2604] [49] Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.
[2605] [43] With an entreaty, herein further shown,
[2606] [66] [Exit Second Clown.]  
[2607] [39] Antiquity forgot, custom not known,

[2610] [40] As if increase of appetite had grown
[2611] [46] Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
[2612] [47] Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
[2613] [44] That our devices still are overthrown;
[2614] [67] Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
[2615] [58] Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
[2616] [47] Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
[2617] [50] That he should weep for her? What would he do,
[2618] [51] Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
[2619] [25] Queen. What shall I do?
[2620] [67] If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
[2621] [52] My operant powers their functions leave to do.
[2622] [44] My stern effects. Then what I have to do
[2623] [45] And let them know both what we mean to do
[2624] [47] Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
[2625] [49] That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
[2626] [67] players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
[2627] [39] He may not, as unvalued persons do,
[2628] [41] Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
[2629] [43] I once did hold it, as our statists do,
[2630] [40] Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
[2631] [48] Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
[2632] [66] O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
[2633] [28] Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.
[2634] [52] Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
[2635] [53] Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
[2636] [49] And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
[2637] [64] Exit Reynaldo.
[2638] [23] Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
[2639] [49] Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.
[2640] [17] Fran. Bernardo?
[2641] [48] And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
[2642] [42] I do beseech you give him leave to go.
[2643] [20] But let that go.
[2644] [68] and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go  
[2645] [45] Which bewept to the grave did not go
[2646] [34] Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
[2647] [40] Why to a public count I might not go
[2648] [13] Gonzago'?
[2649] [71] Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.  
[2650] [37] As infinite as man may undergo-  
[2651] [35] Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
[2652] [10] O, ho!
[2653] [19] Help, help, ho!
[2654] [69] Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
[2655] [19] Ham. Between who?
[2656] [68] tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
[2657] [16] Ham. Saw? who?
[2658] [25] Enter Hamlet and Horatio.
[2659] [64] Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
[2660] [50] Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
[2661] [38] But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
[2662] [67] favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio,
[2663] [25] Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
[2664] [33] Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
[2665] [47] And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
[2666] [66] [Retires with Horatio.]  
[2667] [55] There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
[2668] [25] Ham. What, ho, Horatio!
[2669] [36] Enter Horatio.
[2670] [52] Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
[2671] [52] Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
[2672] [28] Mar. Question it, Horatio.
[2673] [48] Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
[2674] [66] [Exit Horatio.]  
[2675] [64] Exit Horatio.
[2676] [41] Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
[2677] [7] No.
[2678] [34] Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
[2679] [69] Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
[2680] [68] scarcely lie in this box; and must th' inheritor himself have no
[2681] [11] Laer. No.
[2682] [26] Ham. How if I answer no?
[2683] [46] If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
[2684] [42] me, whether you were sent for or no.  
[2685] [62] more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no
[2686] [67] Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
[2687] [62] discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
[2688] [60] Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
[2689] [31] Ham. The point envenom'd too?
[2690] [30] Hor. Let him bless thee too.
[2691] [68] to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
[2692] [50] Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
[2693] [65] very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
[2694] [42] Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
[2695] [37] King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
[2696] [65] monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
[2697] [60] King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;  
[2698] [28] Other. Why, 'tis found so.
[2699] [23] King. It shall be so.
[2700] [23] Laer. Let this be so.
[2701] [47] Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
[2702] [43] As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
[2703] [66] Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
[2704] [47] Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
[2705] [15] Hor. E'en so.
[2706] [42] Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
[2707] [37] Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
[2708] [50] Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?  
[2709] [58] Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.  
[2710] [66] mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
[2711] [45] And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
[2712] [42] That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
[2713] [47] promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.
[2714] [47] I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
[2715] [42] If damned custom have not braz'd it so
[2716] [41] The rather, if you could devise it so
[2717] [31] Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
[2718] [60] Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
[2719] [22] Oph. No more but so?
[2720] [24] And let him know so.
[2721] [55] neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
[2722] [42] Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
[2723] [66] Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
[2724] [28] Ber. It would be spoke to.
[2725] [69] He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
[2726] [69] will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to
[2727] [66] My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to
[2728] [68] soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
[2729] [49] Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
[2730] [15] Other. Go to!
[2731] [68] brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
[2732] [66] bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to
[2733] [68] Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
[2734] [68] Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
[2735] [65] Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
[2736] [68] have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to
[2737] [67] 'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
[2738] [62] Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
[2739] [51] But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
[2740] [64] Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
[2741] [64] Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
[2742] [37] Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
[2743] [37] Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
[2744] [50] Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
[2745] [54] And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
[2746] [33] The tedious day with sleep.
[2747] [44] Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
[2748] [47] And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
[2749] [42] And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
[2750] [52] For some must watch, while some must sleep:
[2751] [48] Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
[2752] [43] To try conclusions, in the basket creep
[2753] [44] Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
[2754] [29] Hor. Hail to your lordship!
[2755] [42] Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
[2756] [32] Oph. What means your lordship?
[2757] [43] Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
[2758] [47] For out o' doors he went without their help
[2759] [43] The bark is ready and the wind at help,
[2760] [48] No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
[2761] [69] sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
[2762] [49] Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
[2763] [40] Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
[2764] [31] You mainly were stirr'd up.
[2765] [46] Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
[2766] [67] find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
[2767] [47] And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
[2768] [46] Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
[2769] [50] A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
[2770] [21] Give him the cup.
[2771] [45] Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
[2772] [48] And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
[2773] [26] All given to mine ear.
[2774] [48] Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
[2775] [65] Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
[2776] [43] And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
[2777] [53] With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
[2778] [42] For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
[2779] [36] Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
[2780] [56] Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
[2781] [41] Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
[2782] [43] Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
[2783] [43] For we will fetters put upon this fear,
[2784] [46] The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
[2785] [34] Ham. For God's love let me hear!
[2786] [32] Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
[2787] [33] Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
[2788] [49] King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
[2789] [53] Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
[2790] [54] Ghost. So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
[2791] [52] Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
[2792] [50] How these things came about. So shall You hear
[2793] [52] Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
[2794] [43] The glowworm shows the matin to be near
[2795] [50] Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
[2796] [37] Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
[2797] [45] And in his grave rain'd many a tear.
[2798] [50] As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
[2799] [10] Swear.
[2800] [25] Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
[2801] [25] Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
[2802] [21] Consent to swear.
[2803] [15] Ghost. Swear.
[2804] [64] [They swear.]
[2805] [18] you nine year.
[2806] [32] Drabbing. You may go so far.
[2807] [66] he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far
[2808] [25] the guts of a beggar.
[2809] [68] we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar
[2810] [45] Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
[2811] [35] Doubt truth to be a liar;
[2812] [45] Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
[2813] [44] Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
[2814] [46] 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
[2815] [44] The soldiers' music and the rites of war
[2816] [43] And foreign mart for implements of war;
[2817] [53] Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
[2818] [30] Ham. I beseech you remember.
[2819] [20] Bernardo, officer.
[2820] [21] Marcellus, Officer.
[2821] [21] Marcellus, officer.
[2822] [56] That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
[2823] [49] And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
[2824] [53] Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
[2825] [49] As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
[2826] [28] King. Pluck thein asunder.
[2827] [52] And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
[2828] [44] And, as I think, they have already order
[2829] [45] Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
[2830] [23] You know the wager?
[2831] [25] Osr. Rapier and dagger.
[2832] [50] Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
[2833] [47] Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
[2834] [51] That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
[2835] [39] Enter a Messenger.
[2836] [64] Exit Messenger.
[2837] [49] That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
[2838] [23] Both. Longer, longer.
[2839] [44] Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
[2840] [54] This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
[2841] [61] Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
[2842] [35] Queen. I will not speak with her.
[2843] [56] Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
[2844] [61] unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
[2845] [38] Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
[2846] [42] To sing a requiem and such rest to her
[2847] [46] Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
[2848] [11] father?
[2849] [49] But you must know, your father lost a father;
[2850] [32] King. Conceit upon her father.
[2851] [53] Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
[2852] [54] King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
[2853] [37] Hor. My lord, the King your father.
[2854] [49] To give these mourning duties to your father;
[2855] [34] Requite him for your father.  
[2856] [45] The apparition comes. I knew your father.
[2857] [27] Ghost of Hamlet's Father.
[2858] [48] Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
[2859] [40] My father- methinks I see my father.
[2860] [51] My father's brother, but no more like my father
[2861] [22] Give me my father!
[2862] [48] Play something like the murther of my father
[2863] [26] Ham. The King my father?
[2864] [69] would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father
[2865] [33] Most throughly for my father.
[2866] [27] Laer. Where is my father?
[2867] [66] entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father
[2868] [46] To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
[2869] [54] The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
[2870] [55] God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
[2871] [35] Nay, come, let's go together.  
[2872] [54] Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
[2873] [51] Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
[2874] [26] Clown. For none neither.
[2875] [11] hither?
[2876] [34] Why does the drum come hither?
[2877] [47] For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
[2878] [29] dare scarce come thither.
[2879] [58] Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
[2880] [53] Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
[2881] [48] Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
[2882] [60] Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
[2883] [48] That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
[2884] [54] 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
[2885] [49] Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
[2886] [46] 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
[2887] [22] Of my true mother.
[2888] [26] Farewell, dear mother.
[2889] [39] Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
[2890] [55] But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
[2891] [23] Good night, mother.
[2892] [54] He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
[2893] [50] And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
[2894] [47] Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
[2895] [51] Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
[2896] [46] Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
[2897] [32] Ham. Why he more than another?
[2898] [66] Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
[2899] [49] As kill a king, and marry with his brother.  
[2900] [50] As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
[2901] [24] And hurt my brother.
[2902] [60] Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
[2903] [49] May give his saying deed; which is no further
[2904] [34] King. How may we try it further?
[2905] [49] Of those effects for which I did the murther-
[2906] [53] Ghost. Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
[2907] [52] Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
[2908] [15] Ham. Murther?
[2909] [44] They bore him barefac'd on the bier
[2910] [22] Francisco, a soldier
[2911] [35] Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
[2912] [68] Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
[2913] [25] Or for some frontier?
[2914] [47] Enter young Osric, a courtier.
[2915] [18] Osric, courtier.
[2916] [22] Voltemand, courtier.
[2917] [24] A Gentleman, courtier.
[2918] [25] Guildenstern, courtier.
[2919] [22] Cornelius, courtier.
[2920] [24] Rosencrantz, courtier.
[2921] [53] his kibe.- How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
[2922] [36] plunge him into far more choler.
[2923] [40] Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
[2924] [42] For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
[2925] [39] And pious action we do sugar o'er  
[2926] [64] [Gives a paper.]
[2927] [64] Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
[2928] [52] The head and source of all your son's distemper.
[2929] [44] Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
[2930] [17] Ham. At supper.
[2931] [65] Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
[2932] [50] That they do know my son, come you more nearer
[2933] [21] Winner and loser?
[2934] [44] Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
[2935] [60] Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
[2936] [41] kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?
[2937] [50] Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
[2938] [69] Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.  
[2939] [22] master's daughter.
[2940] [36] Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
[2941] [14] carpenter?
[2942] [33] shipwright, or the carpenter?
[2943] [69] on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-
[2944] [29] skull, the King's jester.
[2945] [46] That I must be their scourge and minister.
[2946] [46] Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
[2947] [35] Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
[2948] [49] And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
[2949] [31] To hear and see the matter.
[2950] [68] he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter-
[2951] [23] What is the matter?
[2952] [40] How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
[2953] [38] Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
[2954] [40] Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
[2955] [42] I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
[2956] [65] think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.
[2957] [64] [Reads] the letter.
[2958] [53] Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
[2959] [46] O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
[2960] [46] To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  
[2961] [42] With an attent ear, till I may deliver
[2962] [18] Truly deliver.
[2963] [42] That I have longed long to re-deliver.
[2964] [43] Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
[2965] [47] O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
[2966] [44] May be a devil; and the devil hath power
[2967] [43] Giving to you no further personal power
[2968] [43] In general synod take away her power;
[2969] [48] if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
[2970] [37] Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
[2971] [67] while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
[2972] [64] [Exit First Player.]
[2973] [49] My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
[2974] [66] Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
[2975] [67] Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
[2976] [47] But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
[2977] [40] Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
[2978] [44] Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
[2979] [44] Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
[2980] [20] Ham. Are you fair?
[2981] [33] not so wildly from my affair.
[2982] [69] Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
[2983] [63] But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
[2984] [47] Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
[2985] [25] Laer. You mock me, sir.
[2986] [19] Clown. Mine, sir.
[2987] [64] not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
[2988] [22] Guil. The King, sir-
[2989] [23] Ham. With drink, sir?
[2990] [33] much approve me. Well, sir?  
[2991] [30] Ham. Who commands them, sir?
[2992] [19] Ham. Of him, sir.
[2993] [25] Clown. For no man, sir.
[2994] [67] Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
[2995] [20] Ham. Come on, sir.
[2996] [11] Osr. Sir?
[2997] [56] shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
[2998] [66] Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
[2999] [39] Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
[3000] [47] Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
[3001] [55] Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
[3002] [21] Ham. Hear you, sir!
[3003] [23] God bless you, sir!
[3004] [29] Sailor. God bless you, sir.
[3005] [32] Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
[3006] [44] Behind the arras hearing something stir,
[3007] [63] Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
[3008] [27] And all we mourn for.  
[3009] [69] of mercy; but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for
[3010] [67] Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
[3011] [29] That thus he suffers for.
[3012] [37] Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
[3013] [34] Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
[3014] [51] Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author
[3015] [48] Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
[3016] [67] individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
[3017] [55] King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
[3018] [42] And dupp'd the chamber door,
[3019] [49] Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
[3020] [47] Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
[3021] [59] Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
[3022] [11] liquor.
[3023] [44] Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
[3024] [65] trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our
[3025] [67] Clown. Of all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that our
[3026] [52] Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
[3027] [53] Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
[3028] [47] Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
[3029] [54] And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
[3030] [21] Of his behaviour.
[3031] [44] That show of such an exercise may colour
[3032] [44] To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
[3033] [46] Till by some elder masters of known honour
[3034] [47] As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
[3035] [33] All. Our duty to your honour.  
[3036] [32] Player. I warrant your honour.
[3037] [22] Pol. Upon my honour-
[3038] [42] And in the porches of my ears did pour
[3039] [51] Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
[3040] [67] Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
[3041] [69] amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your  
[3042] [62] Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
[3043] [67] were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
[3044] [66] [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on your

[3047] [67] convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
[3048] [65] Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
[3049] [69] Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
[3050] [63] Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
[3051] [69] Clown. 'Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as mad as
[3052] [65] whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
[3053] [64] affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
[3054] [64] Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
[3055] [68] married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
[3056] [44] With windlasses and with assays of bias,
[3057] [19] King. Alas, alas!
[3058] [41] last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
[3059] [43] Tell him that by his license Fortinbras

[3061] [41] To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
[3062] [51] His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
[3063] [49] Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
[3064] [45] Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.

[3067] [50] 'It came to pass, as most like it was.'
[3068] [68] Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it was?
[3069] [52] In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,

[3071] [66] Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]  
[3072] [49] Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
[3073] [53] But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
[3074] [46] And do not spread the compost on the weeds
[3075] [46] Thin settled age his sables and his weeds,
[3076] [49] There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
[3077] [40] Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
[3078] [45] It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
[3079] [42] Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
[3080] [53] Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
[3081] [27] Ham. Hold off your hands!
[3082] [48] And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
[3083] [42] Importing the surrender of those lands
[3084] [51] Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
[3085] [46] Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
[3086] [48] Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
[3087] [44] There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
[3088] [30] As low as to the fiends!
[3089] [53] A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
[3090] [53] O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,  
[3091] [29] Welcome, my good friends.
[3092] [64] question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,
[3093] [54] Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
[3094] [48] As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
[3095] [52] Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
[3096] [48] Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
[3097] [48] Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
[3098] [43] Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
[3099] [31] And passion in the gods.'
[3100] [54] Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,  
[3101] [44] A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
[3102] [68] Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,  
[3103] [44] I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
[3104] [75] Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Lords.
[3105] [68] to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
[3106] [50] Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
[3107] [23] More than in words?
[3108] [27] Ham. Words, words, words.
[3109] [54] Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
[3110] [49] Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
[3111] [46] Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
[3112] [67] lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
[3113] [47] Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places  
[3114] [51] Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
[3115] [35] Ham. What call you the carriages?
[3116] [45] For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
[3117] [57] We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
[3118] [40] carrying torches.
[3119] [37] Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
[3120] [53] And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
[3121] [24] Out of his lunacies.
[3122] [64] Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
[3123] [64] The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
[3124] [64] Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
[3125] [64] Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
[3126] [50] Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
[3127] [42] Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
[3128] [67] Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
[3129] [48] There is no shuffling; there the action lies
[3130] [55] The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
[3131] [49] The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
[3132] [29] Laer. None but his enemies.
[3133] [48] Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
[3134] [42] Some little time; so by your companies
[3135] [50] When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
[3136] [43] And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
[3137] [69] there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties

[3142] [43] The very soul, and sweet religion makes
[3143] [42] Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
[3144] [45] That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
[3145] [48] Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
[3146] [49] Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
[3147] [46] Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
[3148] [55] Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,

[3150] [46] When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
[3151] [46] Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
[3152] [43] For in the fatness of these pursy times
[3153] [69] Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
[3154] [46] 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
[3155] [49] Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
[3156] [46] I stay too long. But here my father comes.
[3157] [31] Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
[3158] [30] where my abridgment comes.
[3159] [47] Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
[3160] [68] the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,

[3165] [50] Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
[3166] [49] Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
[3167] [48] Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
[3168] [51] Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
[3169] [60] Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
[3170] [46] And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
[3171] [50] Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
[3172] [68] Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
[3173] [62] strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's
[3174] [22] Oph. The King rises.
[3175] [47] King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
[3176] [63] Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
[3177] [45] And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
[3178] [43] As harbingers preceding still the fates
[3179] [45] I should have fatted all the region kites
[3180] [45] My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
[3181] [64] At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
[3182] [24] Of mighty opposites.
[3183] [67] and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
[3184] [30] King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
[3185] [23] Enter King and Laertes.
[3186] [56] So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
[3187] [21] King. Good Laertes,
[3188] [53] Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
[3189] [30] Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
[3190] [46] Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
[3191] [35] King. What is the cause, Laertes,
[3192] [36] What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
[3193] [18] Osr. Of Laertes?
[3194] [56] And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
[3195] [49] And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
[3196] [28] King. If it be so, Laertes
[3197] [64] Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
[3198] [64] change rapiers, [and Hamlet wounds Laertes].
[3199] [23] Ham. That is Laertes,
[3200] [49] You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
[3201] [25] Osr. How is't, Laertes?
[3202] [43] Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
[3203] [66] passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes,
[3204] [54] Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
[3205] [60] King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
[3206] [69] the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,
[3207] [42] Into the madness wherein now he raves,
[3208] [69] alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
[3209] [39] To the ambassadors of England gives
[3210] [69] should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves
[3211] [43] Together with remembrance of ourselves.
[3212] [35] Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
[3213] [29] After the thing it loves.
[3214] [45] Enter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].
[3215] [48] In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
[3216] [45] Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
[3217] [47] By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
[3218] [23] Of mine own eyes.  
[3219] [63] have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
[3220] [51] Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
[3221] [47] He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
[3222] [55] Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
[3223] [46] And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
[3224] [52] Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?  
[3225] [65] kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;
[3226] [56] Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
[3227] [51] To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
[3228] [48] Richer than that which four successive kings
[3229] [44] Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
[3230] [48] And leads the will to desperate undertakings
[3231] [47] We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
[3232] [51] O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
[3233] [46] [Clown digs and] sings.

[3241] [46] Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
[3242] [47] If with too credent ear you list his songs,
[3243] [46] O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
[3244] [69] well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is
[3245] [68] Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
[3246] [51] Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
[3247] [68] Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
[3248] [67] Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
[3249] [53] [Aside] To my sick soul (as sin's true nature is)
[3250] [58] Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
[3251] [46] And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
[3252] [39] And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
[3253] [68] man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
[3254] [38] Most holy and religious fear it is
[3255] [49] Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;
[3256] [52] your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
[3257] [68] Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
[3258] [62] comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
[3259] [41] What majesty should be, what duty is,
[3260] [69] how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
[3261] [66] scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
[3262] [65] him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
[3263] [50] If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his  
[3264] [64] Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
[3265] [66] great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
[3266] [63] not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this
[3267] [45] In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
[3268] [42] To make oppression bitter, or ere this
[3269] [69] Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
[3270] [43] And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
[3271] [36] King. Let's further think of this,
[3272] [21] Now, out of this-
[3273] [35] Queen. To whom do you speak this?
[3274] [12] Ham. This?
[3275] [50] Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
[3276] [46] Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
[3277] [41] Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
[3278] [48] Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
[3279] [36] Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
[3280] [51] Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
[3281] [63] chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
[3282] [41] So excellent a king, that was to this
[3283] [44] Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
[3284] [26] Ham. But where was this?
[3285] [48] Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
[3286] [31] What warlike noise is this?
[3287] [35] Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
[3288] [32] Hor. Why, what a king is this!
[3289] [31] King. Do you think 'tis this?
[3290] [20] To tell us this.
[3291] [25] Laer. Why ask you this?
[3292] [27] it means, say you this:
[3293] [65] Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
[3294] [38] King. What dost thou mean by this?  
[3295] [73] Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, cum aliis.
[3296] [48] Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
[3297] [69] lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis
[3298] [49] That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
[3299] [63] Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
[3300] [44] That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
[3301] [50] The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
[3302] [44] As from the body of contraction plucks  
[3303] [36] Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
[3304] [45] Your visitation shall receive such thanks
[3305] [36] Where should We have our thanks?
[3306] [48] With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
[3307] [50] Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
[3308] [64] Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
[3309] [46] Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
[3310] [46] Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
[3311] [42] Her father and myself (lawful espials)
[3312] [64] All may be well.                                  He kneels.
[3313] [53] Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
[3314] [66] Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.  
[3315] [64] [Laertes falls.]
[3316] [49] Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
[3317] [51] Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
[3318] [66] of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
[3319] [43] And in this brainish apprehension kills
[3320] [31] Ham. These tedious old fools!
[3321] [29] As to peace-parted souls.
[3322] [50] With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
[3323] [63] king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
[3324] [52] Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'

[3329] [54] Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
[3330] [41] A sister driven into desp'rate terms,

[3332] [56] Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
[3333] [48] As checking at his voyage, and that he means
[3334] [23] Hor. No, by no means!

[3336] [52] show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
[3337] [43] Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
[3338] [49] Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
[3339] [38] Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
[3340] [46] Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
[3341] [67] Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
[3342] [46] Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
[3343] [56] Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
[3344] [44] Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
[3345] [25] Fort. Let four captains

[3354] [57] With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
[3355] [46] Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
[3356] [35] King. O, for two special reasons,
[3357] [44] The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
[3358] [43] The insolence of office, and the spurns
[3359] [67] Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns

[3361] [48] T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
[3362] [64] [He] sleeps.
[3363] [40] But age with his stealing steps
[3364] [48] But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
[3365] [65] discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
[3366] [51] In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
[3367] [40] The very faculties of eyes and ears.
[3368] [48] These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
[3369] [43] And let us once again assail your ears,

[3371] [53] Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
[3372] [44] Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
[3373] [52] That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
[3374] [46] Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
[3375] [47] The light and careless livery that it wears
[3376] [69] equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years
[3377] [44] you i' th' earth three-and-twenty years.
[3378] [17] thirty years.
[3379] [47] That was and is the question of these wars.
[3380] [50] Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
[3381] [52] Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
[3382] [56] Enter the Players with recorders.  
[3383] [27] Two Clowns, gravediggers.
[3384] [43] Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
[3385] [53] Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
[3386] [68] souls, it touches us not. Let the gall'd jade winch; our withers
[3387] [61] Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.
[3388] [46] Enter Laertes with others.
[3389] [47] Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers

[3391] [47] As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
[3392] [48] And his commission to employ those soldiers,
[3393] [50] Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
[3394] [51] Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
[3395] [60] Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
[3396] [47] Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
[3397] [51] Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.
[3398] [32] But keep a farm and carters.
[3399] [44] Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
[3400] [48] Enter a Messenger with letters.
[3401] [53] Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
[3402] [34] With true-love showers.
[3403] [64] [Scatters flowers.]
[3404] [41] Larded all with sweet flowers;
[3405] [64] Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
[3406] [15] He answers:
[3407] [10] Players.
[3408] [30] Guil. There are the players.
[3409] [38] Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.
[3410] [46] Flourish for the Players.
[3411] [55] With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
[3412] [48] Enter four or five Players.
[3413] [49] Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
[3414] [64] Exeunt Players.
[3415] [50] Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
[3416] [18] Pol. Come, sirs.
[3417] [22] English Ambassadors.
[3418] [48] Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
[3419] [64] Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
[3420] [40] Enter Sailors.
[3421] [51] Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
[3422] [24] within 's two hours.
[3423] [25] To both your honours.
[3424] [12] favours?
[3425] [51] The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
[3426] [44] Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
[3427] [61] Clown. You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.
[3428] [39] Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
[3429] [40] You go not till I set you up a glass
[3430] [41] Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
[3431] [47] That it might please you to give quiet pass
[3432] [52] So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
[3433] [45] Without debatement further, more or less,
[3434] [30] Queen. This is mere madness;
[3435] [47] Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
[3436] [47] And I the matter will reword; which madness
[3437] [41] That I essentially am not in madness,
[3438] [47] Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
[3439] [51] And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
[3440] [42] And that shall lend a kind of easiness
[3441] [57] Hor. Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness.
[3442] [41] Answer, and think upon this business.
[3443] [36] shall be the end of my business.
[3444] [42] She turns to favour and to prettiness.
[3445] [46] Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
[3446] [40] It lifted up it head and did address
[3447] [45] Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
[3448] [43] Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
[3449] [41] As one incapable of her own distress,
[3450] [48] Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
[3451] [48] Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
[3452] [46] And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
[3453] [48] Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
[3454] [52] Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
[3455] [45] Why you proceeded not against these feats
[3456] [55] Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
[3457] [41] Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
[3458] [45] With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
[3459] [54] Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
[3460] [49] Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
[3461] [64] [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
[3462] [50] Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
[3463] [54] With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
[3464] [43] But I do prophesy th' election lights  
[3465] [30] All. Lights, lights, lights!
[3466] [47] And drive his purpose on to these delights.
[3467] [67] Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
[3468] [53] And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
[3469] [56] remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
[3470] [51] Free me so far in your most generous thoughts  
[3471] [57] Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
[3472] [27] shame and the odd hits.
[3473] [45] That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
[3474] [43] As he is very potent with such spirits,
[3475] [43] But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
[3476] [43] But mere implorators of unholy suits,  
[3477] [48] O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
[3478] [42] Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
[3479] [49] Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,

[3487] [12] tenants.
[3488] [46] Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
[3489] [51] As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
[3490] [47] Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
[3491] [52] That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
[3492] [48] And even the like precurse of fierce events,
[3493] [45] Between the pass and fell incensed points
[3494] [48] And there I see such black and grained spots
[3495] [60] seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
[3496] [49] Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts
[3497] [53] Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts;
[3498] [65] question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts
[3499] [49] That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
[3500] [47] To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
[3501] [48] Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
[3502] [11] clouts.
[3503] [47] Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
[3504] [28] King. Bring him before us.
[3505] [25] Both. We will haste us.
[3506] [13] Leave us.
[3507] [49] Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,

[3509] [50] Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
[3510] [26] further trade with us?
[3511] [50] King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
[3512] [44] if that his Majesty would aught with us,
[3513] [47] For your desire to know what is between us,
[3514] [57] When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
[3515] [44] Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
[3516] [47] Be you content to lend your patience to us,
[3517] [55] With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
[3518] [40] 'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
[3519] [44] What is the reason that you use me thus?
[3520] [29] It could not move thus.  
[3521] [49] Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
[3522] [50] Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
[3523] [36] King. How long hath she been thus?
[3524] [29] But you shall hear. Thus:

[3544] [38] King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
[3545] [26] King. Where is Polonius?
[3546] [64] [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
[3547] [57] King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
[3548] [64] [Exit Polonius.]

[3558] [40] Enter Lucianus.
[3559] [55] Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
[3560] [62] it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
[3561] [67] question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous
[3562] [41] Yet have I in me something dangerous,
[3563] [46] Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
[3564] [20] Of blue Olympus.
[3565] [69] Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
[3566] [43] Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
[3567] [53] King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
[3568] [23] How now? What news?
[3569] [56] Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
[3570] [53] This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
[3571] [24] This presence knows,
[3572] [53] Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
[3573] [49] Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
[3574] [50] Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.  
[3575] [64] The cock crows.
[3576] [51] Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
[3577] [44] That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
[3578] [49] And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
[3579] [68] and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.
[3580] [46] As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
[3581] [48] reputation and profit, was better both ways.
[3582] [44] Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
[3583] [62] own grinning? Quite chap- fall'n? Now get you to my lady's
[3584] [45] On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
[3585] [69] Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
[3586] [67] Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
[3587] [62] all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
[3588] [68] Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
[3589] [48] That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
[3590] [49] They are not near my conscience; their defeat
[3591] [45] Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
[3592] [69] But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
[3593] [50] Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
[3594] [47] Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
[3595] [11] I ha't!
[3596] [50] Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
[3597] [64] [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
[3598] [69] How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that
[3599] [66] knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
[3600] [44] As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
[3601] [45] Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
[3602] [19] Clown. E'en that.
[3603] [48] Are most select and generous, chief in that.
[3604] [44] And for my soul, what can it do to that,
[3605] [44] A villain kills my father; and for that,
[3606] [36] Laer. How now? What noise is that?
[3607] [25] Oph. Do you doubt that?
[3608] [65] now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment that
[3609] [45] (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
[3610] [67] tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that
[3611] [22] I would know that.
[3612] [59] Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
[3613] [40] Ham. I must to England; you know that?
[3614] [69] Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
[3615] [67] beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
[3616] [20] Ros. Believe what?
[3617] [65] needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
[3618] [12] Ham. What?
[3619] [66] dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what
[3620] [68] Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
[3621] [50] Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
[3622] [57] Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
[3623] [46] I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
[3624] [47] Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
[3625] [49] To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
[3626] [55] Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
[3627] [31] Is thought-sick at the act.
[3628] [42] At gaming, swearing, or about some act
[3629] [18] Ham. Such an act
[3630] [43] Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
[3631] [47] That are but mutes or audience to this act,
[3632] [42] But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
[3633] [25] Queen. Ay me, what act,
[3634] [26] Ham. What did you enact?
[3635] [55] Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
[3636] [44] Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
[3637] [45] Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
[3638] [44] Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
[3639] [41] The leperous distilment; whose effect
[3640] [46] That we find out the cause of this effect-
[3641] [40] By letters congruing to that effect,
[3642] [53] 'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
[3643] [47] Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
[3644] [43] Must give us pause. There's the respect
[3645] [34] As will not leave their tinct.
[3646] [43] To lay our service freely at your feet,
[3647] [66] [Sits down at Ophelia's feet.]  
[3648] [37] For and a shrouding sheet;
[3649] [53] O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
[3650] [46] (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
[3651] [36] For such a guest is meet.
[3652] [39] For such a guest is meet.
[3653] [48] When in one line two crafts directly meet.  
[3654] [66] counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet
[3655] [49] And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
[3656] [37] Methought it was very sweet;
[3657] [40] Most necessary 'tis that we forget
[3658] [30] Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
[3659] [44] Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
[3660] [31] And put it in his pocket!

[3663] [23] Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
[3664] [64] Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
[3665] [33] How does my good Lord Hamlet?
[3666] [59] Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  
[3667] [50] As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
[3668] [49] I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
[3669] [19] Mar. Lord Hamlet!
[3670] [46] Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
[3671] [42] Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
[3672] [53] That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
[3673] [47] Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
[3674] [65] 'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
[3675] [46] The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
[3676] [58] King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
[3677] [45] This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
[3678] [38] Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
[3679] [71] Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,
[3680] [56] King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,

[3682] [28] Horatio, friend to Hamlet.
[3683] [46] Getrude, Queen of Denmark, mother to Hamlet.
[3684] [56] Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
[3685] [25] Speak to her, Hamlet.
[3686] [34] King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
[3687] [40] Enter Hamlet.
[3688] [38] Enter Hamlet.
[3689] [39] Enter Hamlet.
[3690] [13] Enter Hamlet.
[3691] [47] Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
[3692] [40] King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
[3693] [64] Ghost beckons Hamlet.
[3694] [53] Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
[3695] [26] No more, sweet Hamlet!
[3696] [24] Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
[3697] [52] Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
[3698] [64] Exeunt [all but Hamlet].
[3699] [66] [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]  
[3700] [64] [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
[3701] [64] Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
[3702] [32] Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?  
[3703] [19] King. Ay, Hamlet.
[3704] [25] But you'll be secret?
[3705] [49] Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
[3706] [19] The Queen's closet.
[3707] [50] Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
[3708] [45] Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
[3709] [43] And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
[3710] [69] Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
[3711] [44] And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
[3712] [46] And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
[3713] [32] Here's yet some liquor left.
[3714] [35] Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
[3715] [54] Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
[3716] [63] Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
[3717] [54] From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
[3718] [50] By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
[3719] [49] That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
[3720] [55] Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
[3721] [69] prais'd my Lord Such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it- might
[3722] [62] Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
[3723] [50] Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
[3724] [49] With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
[3725] [24] Ber. Well, good night.
[3726] [47] The death I gave him. So again, good night.
[3727] [28] Fran. Give you good night.
[3728] [44] In the dead vast and middle of the night
[3729] [48] Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
[3730] [45] 'Tis now the very witching time of night,
[3731] [53] Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
[3732] [47] With us to watch the minutes of this night,
[3733] [55] Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
[3734] [47] Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
[3735] [32] Hold you the watch to-night?
[3736] [29] Ham. I will watch to-night.
[3737] [44] Let us impart what we have seen to-night
[3738] [52] Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
[3739] [49] Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
[3740] [52] Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
[3741] [43] That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
[3742] [43] And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
[3743] [46] Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
[3744] [40] Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
[3745] [23] King. It falls right.
[3746] [41] That ever I was born to set it right!
[3747] [48] Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright  
[3748] [45] Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
[3749] [32] And vanish'd from our sight.
[3750] [46] If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
[3751] [28] Fort. Where is this sight?
[3752] [48] Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
[3753] [52] And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
[3754] [27] I never gave you aught.
[3755] [55] Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
[3756] [50] But in our circumstance and course of thought,
[3757] [51] Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
[3758] [53] With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
[3759] [29] Pol. Marry, well bethought!
[3760] [47] But answer made it none. Yet once methought
[3761] [54] Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
[3762] [69] sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
[3763] [49] Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
[3764] [61] Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
[3765] [32] Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
[3766] [65] imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
[3767] [16] Ham. So be it!
[3768] [65] excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
[3769] [47] So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
[3770] [47] A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
[3771] [44] It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
[3772] [24] Hor. Never believe it.
[3773] [25] Ham. Do not believe it.
[3774] [49] Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
[3775] [44] Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
[3776] [43] And draw you into madness? Think of it.
[3777] [43] Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
[3778] [69] I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
[3779] [26] To let you know of it.
[3780] [46] And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
[3781] [26] And will not wrong it.
[3782] [47] Than your particular demands will touch it.
[3783] [49] Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
[3784] [26] But do not go with it!
[3785] [41] Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
[3786] [58] Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
[3787] [68] Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
[3788] [30] Ham. No, you will reveal it.
[3789] [45] Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
[3790] [68] bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?
[3791] [29] Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
[3792] [50] To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
[3793] [42] So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
[3794] [51] A table and flagons of wine on it.  
[3795] [44] He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
[3796] [31] Ham. Did you not speak to it?
[3797] [27] But truly I do fear it.
[3798] [34] Fort. Let us haste to hear it,  
[3799] [41] And am most sensibly in grief for it,
[3800] [20] Ham. Whose was it?
[3801] [46] Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
[3802] [47] Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
[3803] [46] The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
[3804] [29] Hor. Heaven will direct it.
[3805] [48] Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
[3806] [44] It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
[3807] [23] King. We will try it.
[3808] [25] very liberal conceit.
[3809] [46] Could force his soul so to his own conceit
[3810] [45] Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
[3811] [42] repair hither and say you are not fit.
[3812] [46] We would not understand what was most fit,
[3813] [42] And, sister, as the winds give benefit
[3814] [43] If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
[3815] [34] Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
[3816] [49] Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
[3817] [66] Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
[3818] [34] Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
[3819] [48] The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
[3820] [48] Thus much the business is: we have here writ
[3821] [40] And I beseech you instantly to visit
[3822] [48] Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
[3823] [64] Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
[3824] [64] Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
[3825] [64] Give you good night.                                   Exit.
[3826] [5] Exit.
[3827] [64] Capt. God b' wi' you, sir.                             [Exit.]
[3828] [64] they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Exit.
[3829] [64] But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
[3830] [64] ladies. Good night, good night.                         Exit
[3831] [66] Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.  
[3832] [64] We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]
[3833] [64] This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
[3834] [64] Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.
[3835] [64] Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.
[3836] [65] To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.
[3837] [64] My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.
[3838] [64] Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.
[3839] [5] Exit.
[3840] [5] Exit.
[3841] [5] Exit.
[3842] [5] Exit.
[3843] [25] King. I do not think't.
[3844] [52] O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
[3845] [50] Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
[3846] [44] It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
[3847] [43] Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
[3848] [40] So full of artless jealousy is guilt
[3849] [65] calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
[3850] [25] Of general assault.  
[3851] [32] Enter Horatio with an Attendant.
[3852] [16] Lords Attendant.
[3853] [51] Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]
[3854] [64] [Exit Attendant.]
[3855] [44] Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
[3856] [54] And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  
[3857] [45] Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
[3858] [35] Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
[3859] [43] And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
[3860] [47] Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
[3861] [49] And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
[3862] [47] Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
[3863] [51] Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
[3864] [25] And call it accident.
[3865] [48] Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
[3866] [66] Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
[3867] [48] Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
[3868] [41] How in my words somever she be shent,
[3869] [42] A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
[3870] [52] Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
[3871] [31] Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
[3872] [44] I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
[3873] [49] I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
[3874] [16] Ham. Judgment!
[3875] [50] And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
[3876] [54] Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
[3877] [47] Divided from herself and her fair-judgment,
[3878] [47] But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
[3879] [44] And enterprises of great pith and moment
[3880] [42] Is not to stir without great argument,
[3881] [44] This grave shall have a living monument.
[3882] [55] Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
[3883] [44] Contagious blastments are most imminent.
[3884] [42] Which is not tomb enough and continent
[3885] [43] Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
[3886] [10] spent.
[3887] [44] Haply the seas, and countries different,
[3888] [65] very day that young Hamlet was born- he that is mad, and sent
[3889] [43] Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
[3890] [40] Against the which a moiety competent
[3891] [47] My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
[3892] [45] Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
[3893] [27] To give it due content.
[3894] [51] Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
[3895] [42] Makes mouths at the invisible event,  
[3896] [44] Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
[3897] [46] Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
[3898] [32] Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
[3899] [67] Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
[3900] [62] King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
[3901] [68] sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't
[3902] [41] That has no relish of salvation in't-
[3903] [55] Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
[3904] [53] This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
[3905] [9] on't.
[3906] [58] Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
[3907] [24] What think you on't?
[3908] [49] From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
[3909] [43] It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
[3910] [19] I have sworn't.
[3911] [56] Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
[3912] [64] Exeunt.
[3913] [64] Exeunt.
[3914] [64] Exeunt.
[3915] [64] Exeunt.
[3916] [64] Exeunt.
[3917] [64] Exeunt.
[3918] [64] Exeunt.
[3919] [64] Exeunt
[3920] [64] Exeunt.
[3921] [64] Exeunt.
[3922] [64] To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.
[3923] [64] Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
[3924] [64] Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.
[3925] [45] No reckoning made, but sent to my account
[3926] [45] Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
[3927] [20] Laer. I will do't!
[3928] [57] epitaph is 'For O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'
[3929] [45] Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
[3930] [39] That thou so many princes at a shot
[3931] [50] Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
[3932] [49] Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
[3933] [8] not.
[3934] [68] Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
[3935] [23] Laer. O, fear me not!
[3936] [68] King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
[3937] [41] To you in satisfaction; but if not,  
[3938] [40] A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
[3939] [29] Both. My lord, we will not.
[3940] [51] Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
[3941] [49] Of all their conference. If she find him not,
[3942] [69] Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
[3943] [62] Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
[3944] [43] Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
[3945] [67] him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
[3946] [41] Looking before and after, gave us not
[3947] [29] Ham. Nay, that follows not.
[3948] [11] it not?
[3949] [40] Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
[3950] [45] Try what repentance can. What can it not?
[3951] [50] Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
[3952] [17] might it not?
[3953] [69] continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
[3954] [69] Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
[3955] [31] insert in't, could you not?
[3956] [47] Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
[3957] [53] Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
[3958] [23] Ham. Nay, I know not.
[3959] [60] Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
[3960] [32] Ros. No indeed are they not.  
[3961] [26] Guil. My lord, I cannot.
[3962] [29] Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
[3963] [67] Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot
[3964] [21] Ham. Sir, I cannot.
[3965] [64] Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
[3966] [48] With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
[3967] [35] Both. My lord, from head to foot.
[3968] [46] I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
[3969] [31] Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
[3970] [55] Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
[3971] [49] Young men will do't if they come to't
[3972] [53] as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.
[3973] [14] Clown. To't.
[3974] [47] Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
[3975] [32] 'As by lot, God wot,'
[3976] [25] Ghost. I find thee apt;
[3977] [53] The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
[3978] [45] But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
[3979] [36] Queen. More matter, with less art.
[3980] [28] A face without a heart,'
[3981] [45] The head is not more native to the heart,
[3982] [49] In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
[3983] [63] There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
[3984] [47] This something-settled matter in his heart,
[3985] [27] And I am sick at heart.
[3986] [44] If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
[3987] [50] And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
[3988] [42] It warms the very sickness in my heart
[3989] [24] Ham. Nay, but swear't.
[3990] [50] Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
[3991] [47] I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
[3992] [43] Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
[3993] [44] Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
[3994] [39] Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
[3995] [49] We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
[3996] [68] Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart
[3997] [60] sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.
[3998] [67] Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
[3999] [58] Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
[4000] [45] Lest with this piteous action you convert
[4001] [66] a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.  
[4002] [41] To make it truster of your own report
[4003] [39] And gave you such a masterly report
[4004] [41] And with a look so piteous in purport
[4005] [47] When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
[4006] [40] As it is common for the younger sort
[4007] [49] That she should lock herself from his resort,
[4008] [49] King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
[4009] [49] To hear of it. They are here about the court,
[4010] [50] That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
[4011] [52] Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
[4012] [56] 'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
[4013] [51] My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
[4014] [51] Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
[4015] [42] Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
[4016] [60] Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
[4017] [66] will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
[4018] [39] By laboursome petition, and at last
[4019] [52] All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
[4020] [51] To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
[4021] [23] Laer. A Norman was't?
[4022] [41] A couch for luxury and damned incest.
[4023] [54] the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
[4024] [11] A Priest.
[4025] [53] May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
[4026] [42] And when you are desirous to be blest,
[4027] [56] Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
[4028] [30] Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
[4029] [32] Queen. O, confound the rest!
[4030] [48] And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
[4031] [46] That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
[4032] [29] Give me one poor request.
[4033] [41] This heavy-headed revel east and west
[4034] [23] Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
[4035] [52] To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
[4036] [39] The ocean, overpeering of his list,
[4037] [36] Enter Ghost.
[4038] [37] Enter Ghost.
[4039] [24] Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
[4040] [64] Exit Ghost.
[4041] [64] Exit Ghost.
[4042] [64] Exit Ghost.
[4043] [53] As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
[4044] [42] Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
[4045] [49] Whose motive in this case should stir me most
[4046] [64] servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
[4047] [46] She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
[4048] [51] None wed the second but who killed the first.
[4049] [64] Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].
[4050] [45] dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
[4051] [44] When second husband let me be accurst!
[4052] [41] Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
[4053] [42] Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
[4054] [43] So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
[4055] [47] Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
[4056] [50] Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
[4057] [50] That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
[4058] [44] them to their trial-the bubbles are out,
[4059] [51] And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
[4060] [42] Make you to ravel all this matter out,
[4061] [55] When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
[4062] [24] Ham. My fate cries out
[4063] [40] By indirections find directions out.
[4064] [33] philosophy could find it out.
[4065] [27] Treachery! Seek it out.
[4066] [44] The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
[4067] [45] And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
[4068] [50] That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
[4069] [57] Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
[4070] [43] The trumpet to the cannoneer without,  
[4071] [24] Hor. Not when I saw't.
[4072] [46] I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
[4073] [14] it. Adieu.
[4074] [68] them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou
[4075] [30] I'll rant as well as thou.
[4076] [29] For husband shalt thou-
[4077] [63] Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
[4078] [23] 'Thus didest thou.'
[4079] [20] So, proceed you.
[4080] [66] inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
[4081] [26] Who hath reliev'd you?
[4082] [37] Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
[4083] [46] Moreover that we much did long to see you,
[4084] [66] Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
[4085] [52] To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
[4086] [50] To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
[4087] [56] Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
[4088] [67] there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you
[4089] [52] Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
[4090] [46] My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
[4091] [20] my leave of you.
[4092] [34] King. He made confession of you;
[4093] [45] Where you may see the inmost part of you.
[4094] [69] given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
[4095] [21] Hor. I beseech you.
[4096] [24] Ham. I do beseech you.
[4097] [46] Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
[4098] [51] Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
[4099] [59] Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
[4100] [43] And he to England shall along with you.
[4101] [47] And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
[4102] [35] Queen. Alas, how is't with you,  
[4103] [45] Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
[4104] [60] And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.
[4105] [67] Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
[4106] [44] Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
[4107] [13] Mark you,
[4108] [49] Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
[4109] [48] It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
[4110] [40] Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
[4111] [47] And that in way of caution- I must tell you
[4112] [29] But let me hear from you.
[4113] [64] The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
[4114] [52] King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
[4115] [35] Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
[4116] [30] Both. We'll wait upon you.  
[4117] [64] Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
[4118] [67] for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you
[4119] [28] What I have said to you.
[4120] [47] Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
[4121] [44] With all my love I do commend me to you;
[4122] [65] Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again from me to you.
[4123] [24] hath sent me to you.
[4124] [52] May do t' express his love and friending to you,
[4125] [23] This marvel to you.
[4126] [45] King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
[4127] [63] Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
[4128] [50] So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
[4129] [69] my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter! My mother, you  
[4130] [67] Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
[4131] [67] Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
[4132] [66] Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
[4133] [22] have sent for you.
[4134] [57] Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
[4135] [48] Before my daughter told me), what might you,
[4136] [19] I'll visit you.
[4137] [54] You, as your business and desires shall point you,
[4138] [58] King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
[4139] [18] Ham. I pray you.
[4140] [37] Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
[4141] [22] Ham. Arm'd, say you?
[4142] [44] Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
[4143] [49] Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
[4144] [27] King. Who shall stay you?
[4145] [26] Queen. I shall obey you;

[4151] [66] the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
[4152] [46] Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
[4153] [25] Other. But is this law?
[4154] [46] Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.
[4155] [51] Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
[4156] [47] Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw  
[4157] [42] But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
[4158] [47] Will not debate the question of this straw.
[4159] [31] know a hawk from a handsaw.
[4160] [40] Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
[4161] [42] High on a stage be placed to the view;
[4162] [49] Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
[4163] [47] Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
[4164] [58] Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
[4165] [38] Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
[4166] [32] it is but a shadow's shadow.
[4167] [40] And I a maid at your window,
[4168] [46] But I have that within which passeth show-
[4169] [49] Not of that dye which their investments show,
[4170] [66] through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
[4171] [50] The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
[4172] [58] King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
[4173] [49] A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
[4174] [27] Therefore let's follow.
[4175] [54] The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
[4176] [69] of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now
[4177] [65] But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
[4178] [34] Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
[4179] [29] Ham. What's the matter now?
[4180] [48] How to forget that learning; but, sir, now  
[4181] [21] Ham. What hour now?
[4182] [24] I be so able as now.
[4183] [34] Ham. If she should break it now!
[4184] [16] See you now-
[4185] [50] Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
[4186] [24] Laer. Have at you now!
[4187] [47] And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
[4188] [41] How should I your true-love know
[4189] [47] Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
[4190] [24] King. Not that I know.
[4191] [29] And tell you what I know.
[4192] [51] But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
[4193] [50] Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
[4194] [48] And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
[4195] [47] And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
[4196] [30] Oph. My lord, I do not know,
[4197] [46] It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
[4198] [52] Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
[4199] [20] and then, you know,
[4200] [50] (Sings) White his shroud as the mountain snow-
[4201] [40] His beard was as white as snow,
[4202] [48] And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
[4203] [45] See what a grace was seated on this brow;
[4204] [59] sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
[4205] [39] Does by their own insinuation grow.
[4206] [41] Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
[4207] [42] And in the cup an union shall he throw
[4208] [50] And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
[4209] [56] Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
[4210] [45] Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
[4211] [50] Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
[4212] [47] That it went hand in hand even with the vow
[4213] [41] To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
[4214] [49] That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
[4215] [68] translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
[4216] [45] How does your honour for this many a day?
[4217] [52] Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
[4218] [42] And do such bitter business as the day
[4219] [45] And it must follow, as the night the day,
[4220] [40] I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
[4221] [47] (Sings) To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
[4222] [48] The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
[4223] [51] The changeling never known. Now, the next day  
[4224] [50] From the first corse till he that died to-day,
[4225] [47] No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
[4226] [48] That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
[4227] [49] Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
[4228] [46] Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
[4229] [48] The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
[4230] [64] Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
[4231] [45] That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
[4232] [33] The hart ungalled play;
[4233] [57] Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
[4234] [58] Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
[4235] [34] King. What do you call the play?
[4236] [26] Pol. Give o'er the play.
[4237] [42] But if you hold it fit, after the play
[4238] [64] Prepare to play.
[4239] [38] Laertes before you fall to play.  
[4240] [37] Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
[4241] [47] For they are actions that a man might play;
[4242] [64] Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
[4243] [47] And will this brother's wager frankly play.
[4244] [40] Let Hercules himself do what he may,
[4245] [48] Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
[4246] [53] With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
[4247] [28] Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
[4248] [42] My soul is full of discord and dismay.
[4249] [51] That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
[4250] [48] And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
[4251] [27] Look you, I'll go pray.
[4252] [8] say-
[4253] [11] O, say!
[4254] [69] Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
[4255] [11] Ber. Say-
[4256] [57] Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
[4257] [67] answer is I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
[4258] [31] i' th' university, you say?
[4259] [64] gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
[4260] [34] Clown. Very strangely, they say.
[4261] [49] Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.  
[4262] [27] Osr. Nothing neither way.
[4263] [49] They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
[4264] [35] Thus runs the world away.
[4265] [44] Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
[4266] [30] King. O Gertrude, come away!
[4267] [45] And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
[4268] [42] Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
[4269] [44] And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
[4270] [40] Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
[4271] [41] If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
[4272] [27] Ber. See, it stalks away!
[4273] [54] Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!  
[4274] [33] King. Give me some light! Away!
[4275] [35] Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
[4276] [49] For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
[4277] [33] Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.  
[4278] [46] Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
[4279] [49] Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
[4280] [48] That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
[4281] [53] Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
[4282] [22] Here in the lobby.
[4283] [30] the stair, into the lobby.
[4284] [43] top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.
[4285] [46] Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
[4286] [38] The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
[4287] [40] With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
[4288] [40] No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
[4289] [41] That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
[4290] [65] so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
[4291] [37] Here stooping to your clemency,
[4292] [36] That he is open to incontinency.
[4293] [50] To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
[4294] [46] Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
[4295] [25] Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
[4296] [22] the players ready.
[4297] [19] make you ready.
[4298] [39] Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
[4299] [25] Thou know'st already.
[4300] [29] One word more, good lady.
[4301] [40] (Sings) He is dead and gone, lady,  
[4302] [32] Ham. How is it with you, lady?
[4303] [32] King. How do you, pretty lady?
[4304] [37] Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
[4305] [41] That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
[4306] [45] For if the King like not the comedy,
[4307] [64] Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
[4308] [37] Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
[4309] [55] Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
[4310] [53] King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
[4311] [45] The natural gates and alleys of the body,
[4312] [51] Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
[4313] [68] Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
[4314] [23] All my smooth body.
[4315] [44] And makes each petty artire in this body
[4316] [49] With which she followed my poor father's body
[4317] [44] Unto the voice and yielding of that body
[4318] [49] Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
[4319] [48] But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
[4320] [25] Guil. But we both obey,
[4321] [9] they?
[4322] [63] Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
[4323] [64] [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then] in scuffling, they
[4324] [69] ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They
[4325] [24] This warlike volley.
[4326] [42] Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
[4327] [11] Ham. Why,
[4328] [11] Ham. Why,
[4329] [11] Ham. Why?
[4330] [27] humanity so abominably.
[4331] [27] Ham. I embrace it freely,
[4332] [59] Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
[4333] [21] Ham. How strangely?
[4334] [53] Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
[4335] [67] Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
[4336] [42] On wholesome life usurp immediately.
[4337] [13] waterfly?
[4338] [34] Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
[4339] [41] argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.
[4340] [51] Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
[4341] [44] Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
[4342] [25] Yes, faith, heartily.
[4343] [44] Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
[4344] [50] Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
[4345] [39] tongue? You will do't, sir, really.
[4346] [40] And for your rapier most especially,
[4347] [66] Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
[4348] [58] For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
[4349] [41] Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
[4350] [44] King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
[4351] [27] Most free in his reply.
[4352] [66] appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
[4353] [56] Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
[4354] [45] You do not understand yourself so clearly
[4355] [61] Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
[4356] [69] Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
[4357] [54] With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
[4358] [23] Hor. Most constantly.
[4359] [62] Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
[4360] [45] Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
[4361] [45] Been struck so to the soul that presently
[4362] [61] That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
[4363] [68] Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my
[4364] [62] Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
[4365] [66] feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my
[4366] [65] pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
[4367] [68] I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
[4368] [68] willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my
[4369] [67] I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
[4370] [66] heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my
[4371] [37] Directly seasons him his enemy.
[4372] [39] His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
[4373] [65] Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
[4374] [66] Clown. Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die (as we have many
[4375] [44] And hath abatements and delays as many  
[4376] [58] Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
[4377] [41] (Hey non nony, nony, hey nony)
[4378] [69] Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy  
[4379] [43] Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
[4380] [43] And there did seem in him a kind of joy
[4381] [47] Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
[4382] [42] Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
[4383] [41] The violence of either grief or joy
[4384] [48] [Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
[4385] [50] Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
[4386] [50] Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
[4387] [44] Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
[4388] [67] spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
[4389] [42] As England was his faithful tributary,
[4390] [54] Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!  
[4391] [46] When in your motion you are hot and dry-  
[4392] [66] glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry
[4393] [38] Well ratified by law and heraldry,
[4394] [46] And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
[4395] [47] I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
[4396] [41] And our vain blows malicious mockery.
[4397] [40] He likewise gives a frock or livery,
[4398] [41] Purpose is but the slave to memory,
[4399] [40] And these few precepts in thy memory
[4400] [36] Yea, from the table of my memory
[4401] [44] That are so fortified against our story,
[4402] [28] Ham. Sir, a whole history.
[4403] [49] Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
[4404] [69] Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
[4405] [46] That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
[4406] [47] And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
[4407] [23] Of man and country-
[4408] [37] A station like the herald Mercury
[4409] [66] there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
[4410] [45] With this regard their currents turn awry
[4411] [68] Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
[4412] [47] To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
[4413] [44] Is not this something more than fantasy?
[4414] [41] Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
[4415] [15] Ham. Ecstasy?
[4416] [34] This bodiless creation ecstasy
[4417] [39] For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
[4418] [53] And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
[4419] [21] Than to entreaty.
[4420] [54] King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
[4421] [27] tragedians of the city.
[4422] [42] Of violent birth, but poor validity;
[4423] [47] And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
[4424] [67] gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity
[4425] [40] In neither aught, or in extremity.
[4426] [43] From me, whose love was of that dignity
[4427] [41] Passing through nature to eternity.  
[4428] [34] To his unmast'red importunity.
[4429] [51] That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
[4430] [42] [Sings] By Gis and by Saint Charity,  
[4431] [47] For women's fear and love holds quantity,
[4432] [52] As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
[4433] [39] If you desire to know the certainty
[4434] [25] To youth and liberty.
[4435] [45] That they may seem the taints of liberty,
[4436] [41] Thy natural magic and dire property
[4437] [23] Over the nasty sty!
[4438] [46] That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
[4439] [67] Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
[4440] [43] The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
[4441] [41] That live and feed upon your Majesty.
[4442] [51] To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
[4443] [67] Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
[4444] [36] a thing to you from his Majesty.
[4445] [69] Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
[4446] [10] musty.
[4447] [40] Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
[4448] [29] discourse to your beauty.
[4449] [46] As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
[4450] [45] And we did think it writ down in our duty
[4451] [61] Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
[4452] [51] Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
[4453] [44] Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
[4454] [39] Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
[4455] [62] march. [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,
[4456] [55] Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.  
[4457] [38] Enter Rosencrantz.
[4458] [18] Ham. Buzz, buzz!
