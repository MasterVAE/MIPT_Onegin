[545]       But fill unshaken when they mellow be.
[546]       But if the gods themselves did see her then,
[547]       But what we do determine oft we break.
[548]       But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
[549]       But woe is me! you are so sick of late,

[559]       For husband shalt thou-
[560]       For who not needs shall never lack a friend,

[567]       In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
[568]       In general synod take away her power;
[569]       In neither aught, or in extremity.
[570]       Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
[571]       Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
[572]       Most necessary 'tis that we forget
[573]       My operant powers their functions leave to do.
[574]       My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
[575]       Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
[576]       None wed the second but who killed the first.
[577]       Now falls on Priam.
[578]       Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
[579]       Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
[580]       Of violent birth, but poor validity;
[581]       On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
[582]       On wholesome life usurp immediately.
[583]       Ophelia,'-
[584]       Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
[585]       Our wills and fates do so contrary run
[586]       Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,  
[587]       Purpose is but the slave to memory,
[588]       Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
[589]       Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
[590]       Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
[591]       Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
[592]       Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
[593]       So far from cheer and from your former state.
[594]       So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
[595]       So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
[596]       Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
[597]       Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
[598]       Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
[599]       Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
[600]       Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
[601]       Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
[602]       That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
[603]       That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
[604]       That our devices still are overthrown;
[605]       The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
[606]       The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
[607]       The instant burst of clamour that she made
[608]       The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
[609]       The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
[610]       The tedious day with sleep.
[611]       The violence of either grief or joy
[612]       Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
[613]       This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
[614]       Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
[615]       Thy natural magic and dire property
[616]       To desperation turn my trust and hope,
[617]       To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
[618]       Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
[619]       We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]
[620]       What to ourselves in passion we propose,
[621]       When second husband kisses me in bed.
[622]       When second husband let me be accurst!
[623]       When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
[624]       Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
[625]       Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
[626]       Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
[627]       Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
[628]       Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
[629]       Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,

[632]       With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,

[754]     And bear it to the chapel.
[755]     And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
[756]     And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
[757]     And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
[758]     And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
[759]     And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
[760]     And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
[761]     And break your own neck down.
[762]     And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
[763]     And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
[764]     And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
[765]     And call it accident.
[766]     And call the noblest to the audience.
[767]     And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
[768]     And carriage of the article design'd,
[769]     And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
[770]     And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
[771]     And could of men distinguish, her election
[772]     And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
[773]     And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
[774]     And do not spread the compost on the weeds
[775]     And do such bitter business as the day
[776]     And do't the speedier that you may direct me
[777]     And draw you into madness? Think of it.
[778]     And drive his purpose on to these delights.
[779]     And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
[780]     And each particular hair to stand an end
[781]     And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
[782]     And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
[783]     And enterprises of great pith and moment
[784]     And even the like precurse of fierce events,
[785]     And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
[786]     And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
[787]     And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
[788]     And for his death no wind
[789]     And for my means, I'll husband them so well
[790]     And for my soul, what can it do to that,
[791]     And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
[792]     And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
[793]     And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
[794]     And for your rapier most especially,
[795]     And foreign mart for implements of war;
[796]     And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
[797]     And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
[798]     And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
[799]     And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
[800]     And gave you such a masterly report
[801]     And gem of all the nation.
[802]     And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
[803]     And hath abatements and delays as many  
[804]     And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
[805]     And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
[806]     And he to England shall along with you.
[807]     And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
[808]     And hears it roar beneath.
[809]     And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
[810]     And his commission to employ those soldiers,
[811]     And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
[812]     And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
[813]     And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
[814]     And hurt my brother.
[815]     And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
[816]     And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
[817]     And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
[818]     And in the cup an union shall he throw
[819]     And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
[820]     And in the porches of my ears did pour
[821]     And in this brainish apprehension kills
[822]     And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
[823]     And it must follow, as the night the day,
[824]     And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
[825]     And lay your hands again upon my sword.
[826]     And leads the will to desperate undertakings
[827]     And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
[828]     And let him know so.
[829]     And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
[830]     And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
[831]     And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
[832]     And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
[833]     And let them know both what we mean to do
[834]     And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
[835]     And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
[836]     And let us once again assail your ears,
[837]     And live the purer with the other half,
[838]     And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
[839]     And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
[840]     And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
[841]     And makes each petty artire in this body
[842]     And makes us rather bear those ills we have
[843]     And many such-like as's of great charge,
[844]     And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
[845]     And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
[846]     And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame  
[847]     And more above, hath his solicitings,
[848]     And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
[849]     And my imaginations are as foul
[850]     And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
[851]     And not have strew'd thy grave.
[852]     And not where I had aim'd them.
[853]     And nothing is at a like goodness still;
[854]     And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
[855]     And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
[856]     And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
[857]     And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.
[858]     And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
[859]     And our affairs from England come too late.  
[860]     And our vain blows malicious mockery.
[861]     And pious action we do sugar o'er  
[862]     And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
[863]     And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
[864]     And prey on garbage.
[865]     And prologue to the omen coming on,
[866]     And put it in his pocket!  
[867]     And reason panders will.
[868]     And recks not his own rede.
[869]     And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
[870]     And set a double varnish on the fame
[871]     And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
[872]     And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
[873]     And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
[874]     And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
[875]     And so, without more circumstance at all,
[876]     And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
[877]     And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
[878]     And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
[879]     And sure I am two men there are not living
[880]     And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
[881]     And tell you what I know.
[882]     And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
[883]     And that I see, in passages of proof,
[884]     And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
[885]     And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
[886]     And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
[887]     And that in way of caution- I must tell you
[888]     And that our drift look through our bad performance.
[889]     And that shall lend a kind of easiness
[890]     And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
[891]     And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-  
[892]     And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
[893]     And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
[894]     And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
[895]     And there I see such black and grained spots
[896]     And there assume some other, horrible form
[897]     And there did seem in him a kind of joy
[898]     And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
[899]     And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
[900]     And these few precepts in thy memory
[901]     And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  
[902]     And they in France of the best rank and station
[903]     And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
[904]     And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
[905]     And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
[906]     And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
[907]     And thus a while the fit will work on him.
[908]     And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
[909]     And thus the native hue of resolution
[910]     And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
[911]     And thy commandment all alone shall live
[912]     And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
[913]     And to the last bended their light on me.
[914]     And to the manner born, it is a custom
[915]     And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
[916]     And vanish'd from our sight.
[917]     And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
[918]     And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
[919]     And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
[920]     And we beseech you, bend you to remain
[921]     And we did think it writ down in our duty
[922]     And we shall jointly labour with your soul
[923]     And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
[924]     And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
[925]     And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
[926]     And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
[927]     And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
[928]     And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
[929]     And when you are desirous to be blest,
[930]     And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
[931]     And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
[932]     And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
[933]     And will not let belief take hold of him
[934]     And will not wrong it.
[935]     And will this brother's wager frankly play.
[936]     And with a larger tether may he walk
[937]     And with a look so piteous in purport
[938]     And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
[939]     And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
[940]     And with no less nobility of love
[941]     And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
[942]     And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
[943]     And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
[944]     And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
[945]     And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
[946]     And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
[947]     And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
[948]     And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
[949]     And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
[950]     And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
[951]     And, as I think, they have already order
[952]     And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
[953]     And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
[954]     And, as the world were now but to begin,
[955]     And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
[956]     And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
[957]     And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
[958]     And, like a man to double business bound,
[959]     And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
[960]     And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
[961]     And, sister, as the winds give benefit
[962]     And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
[963]     Anon, as patient as the female dove
[964]     Answer, and think upon this business.
[965]     Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
[966]     Appears before them and with solemn march
[967]     Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid  
[968]     Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
[969]     Are joyfully return'd.
[970]     Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
[971]     Are most select and generous, chief in that.
[972]     Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
[973]     Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.  
[974]     As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
[975]     As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
[976]     As England was his faithful tributary,
[977]     As I do thee. Something too much of this I
[978]     As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
[979]     As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
[980]     As are companions noted and most known
[981]     As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
[982]     As checking at his voyage, and that he means
[983]     As day does to your eye.
[984]     As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
[985]     As did that one; and that, in my regard,
[986]     As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
[987]     As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
[988]     As fits a king's remembrance.
[989]     As from the body of contraction plucks  
[990]     As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
[991]     As harbingers preceding still the fates
[992]     As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
[993]     As he in his particular act and place
[994]     As he is very potent with such spirits,
[995]     As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
[996]     As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
[997]     As if he had been loosed out of hell
[998]     As if increase of appetite had grown
[999]     As if it some impartment did desire
[1000]     As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
[1001]     As infinite as man may undergo-  
[1002]     As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
[1003]     As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
[1004]     As it doth well appear unto our state,
[1005]     As it hath us'd to do- that I have found  
[1006]     As it is common for the younger sort
[1007]     As kill a king, and marry with his brother.  
[1008]     As level as the cannon to his blank,
[1009]     As love between them like the palm might flourish,
[1010]     As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
[1011]     As make your bouts more violent to that end-
[1012]     As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
[1013]     As meditation or the thoughts of love,
[1014]     As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
[1015]     As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
[1016]     As of a father; for let the world take note
[1017]     As oft as any passion under heaven
[1018]     As one incapable of her own distress,
[1019]     As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
[1020]     As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
[1021]     As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
[1022]     As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
[1023]     As therein are set down.
[1024]     As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
[1025]     As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
[1026]     As to expend your time with us awhile
[1027]     As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
[1028]     As to peace-parted souls.
[1029]     As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
[1030]     As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
[1031]     As will not leave their tinct.
[1032]     As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
[1033]     Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
[1034]     At gaming, swearing, or about some act
[1035]     At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
[1036]     At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
[1037]     At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
[1038]     Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
[1039]     Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
[1040]     Away! for everything is seal'd and done
[1041]     Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
[1042]     Be all my sins rememb'red.
[1043]     Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
[1044]     Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
[1045]     Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
[1046]     Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
[1047]     Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
[1048]     Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
[1049]     Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
[1050]     Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
[1051]     Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
[1052]     Be you and I behind an arras then.
[1053]     Be you content to lend your patience to us,
[1054]     Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
[1055]     Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
[1056]     Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
[1057]     Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
[1058]     Been struck so to the soul that presently
[1059]     Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
[1060]     Before You visit him, to make inquire
[1061]     Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
[1062]     Before my daughter told me), what might you,
[1063]     Behind the arras I'll convey myself
[1064]     Behind the arras hearing something stir,
[1065]     Being a thing immortal as itself?  
[1066]     Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
[1067]     Believe so much in him, that he is young,
[1068]     Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
[1069]     Between the pass and fell incensed points
[1070]     Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
[1071]     Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?  
[1072]     Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
[1073]     Both to my God and to my gracious king;
[1074]     Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
[1075]     Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
[1076]     Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
[1077]     Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
[1078]     Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
[1079]     Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
[1080]     But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
[1081]     But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
[1082]     But I do prophesy th' election lights  
[1083]     But I have that within which passeth show-
[1084]     But I will delve one yard below their mines
[1085]     But answer made it none. Yet once methought
[1086]     But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
[1087]     But better look'd into, he truly found
[1088]     But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
[1089]     But come!
[1090]     But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
[1091]     But do not go with it!
[1092]     But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
[1093]     But even then the morning cock crew loud,
[1094]     But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
[1095]     But from what cause he will by no means speak.
[1096]     But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
[1097]     But he's an arrant knave.
[1098]     But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
[1099]     But if you hold it fit, after the play
[1100]     But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
[1101]     But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
[1102]     But in battalions! First, her father slain;
[1103]     But in our circumstance and course of thought,
[1104]     But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
[1105]     But keep a farm and carters.
[1106]     But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
[1107]     But let me hear from you.
[1108]     But let that go.
[1109]     But let this same be presently perform'd,
[1110]     But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
[1111]     But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
[1112]     But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
[1113]     But mere implorators of unholy suits,  
[1114]     But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
[1115]     But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
[1116]     But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
[1117]     But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
[1118]     But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
[1119]     But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
[1120]     But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
[1121]     But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
[1122]     But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
[1123]     But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-
[1124]     But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
[1125]     But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
[1126]     But that I know love is begun by time,
[1127]     But that the dread of something after death-
[1128]     But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
[1129]     But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
[1130]     But this eternal blazon must not be
[1131]     But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
[1132]     But to confront the visage of offence?
[1133]     But to my mind, though I am native here  
[1134]     But to recover of us, by strong hand
[1135]     But truly I do fear it.
[1136]     But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
[1137]     But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
[1138]     But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
[1139]     But what is your affair in Elsinore?
[1140]     But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
[1141]     But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
[1142]     But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
[1143]     But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
[1144]     But you must know, your father lost a father;
[1145]     But you shall hear. Thus:
[1146]     But you'll be secret?
[1147]     But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
[1148]     But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
[1149]     But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
[1150]     But, like the owner of a foul disease,
[1151]     But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
[1152]     Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
[1153]     By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
[1154]     By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
[1155]     By heaven, it is as proper to our age
[1156]     By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
[1157]     By indirections find directions out.
[1158]     By laboursome petition, and at last
[1159]     By letters congruing to that effect,
[1160]     By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
[1161]     By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
[1162]     By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
[1163]     By this encompassment and drift of question
[1164]     By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
[1165]     Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
[1166]     Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
[1167]     Can you advise me?
[1168]     Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
[1169]     Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
[1170]     Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
[1171]     Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
[1172]     Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,  
[1173]     Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
[1174]     Collected from all simples that have virtue
[1175]     Come hither, gentlemen,
[1176]     Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
[1177]     Come short of what he did.
[1178]     Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
[1179]     Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
[1180]     Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
[1181]     Come, some music!
[1182]     Come.
[1183]     Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
[1184]     Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
[1185]     Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
[1186]     Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
[1187]     Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
[1188]     Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
[1189]     Consent to swear.
[1190]     Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
[1191]     Contagious blastments are most imminent.
[1192]     Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
[1193]     Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
[1194]     Couch we awhile, and mark.
[1195]     Could force his soul so to his own conceit
[1196]     Could not (with all their quantity of love)
[1197]     Could not so mope.
[1198]     Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
[1199]     Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
[1200]     Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
[1201]     Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
[1202]     Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
[1203]     Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
[1204]     Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
[1205]     Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
[1206]     Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
[1207]     Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
[1208]     Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
[1209]     Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
[1210]     Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
[1211]     Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
[1212]     Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
[1213]     Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
[1214]     Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
[1215]     Did not together pluck such envy from him
[1216]     Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
[1217]     Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
[1218]     Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
[1219]     Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
[1220]     Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
[1221]     Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw  
[1222]     Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
[1223]     Divided from herself and her fair-judgment,
[1224]     Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
[1225]     Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
[1226]     Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
[1227]     Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
[1228]     Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
[1229]     Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
[1230]     Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
[1231]     Does by their own insinuation grow.
[1232]     Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
[1233]     Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
[1234]     Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
[1235]     Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
[1236]     Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
[1237]     Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
[1238]     Drabbing. You may go so far.
[1239]     Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
[1240]     Each small annexment, petty consequence,
[1241]     Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
[1242]     Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
[1243]     Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
[1244]     Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
[1245]     Elsinore.
[1246]     Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
[1247]     Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
[1248]     Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
[1249]     Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
[1250]     Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
[1251]     Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
[1252]     Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
[1253]     Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
[1254]     Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
[1255]     Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
[1256]     Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
[1257]     Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
[1258]     Even with the very comment of thy soul
[1259]     Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
[1260]     Excitements of my reason and my blood,
[1261]     Exposing what is mortal and unsure
[1262]     Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
[1263]     Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
[1264]     Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
[1265]     Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
[1266]     Fare you well, my dove!
[1267]     Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
[1268]     Farewell, dear mother.
[1269]     Farewell.
[1270]     Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
[1271]     Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
[1272]     Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
[1273]     Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
[1274]     Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
[1275]     Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
[1276]     Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
[1277]     Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
[1278]     Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
[1279]     Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
[1280]     Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
[1281]     For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
[1282]     For England.
[1283]     For Hecuba!
[1284]     For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
[1285]     For art and exercise in your defence,
[1286]     For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
[1287]     For by the image of my cause I see
[1288]     For every man hath business and desire,
[1289]     For food and diet, to some enterprise
[1290]     For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
[1291]     For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
[1292]     For he himself is subject to his birth.
[1293]     For he was likely, had he been put on,
[1294]     For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
[1295]     For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
[1296]     For in the fatness of these pursy times
[1297]     For it is as the air, invulnerable,
[1298]     For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
[1299]     For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
[1300]     For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
[1301]     For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
[1302]     For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
[1303]     For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
[1304]     For nature crescent does not grow alone
[1305]     For out o' doors he went without their help
[1306]     For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
[1307]     For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
[1308]     For the demand of our neglected tribute.
[1309]     For the supply and profit of our hope,
[1310]     For they are actions that a man might play;
[1311]     For this effect defective comes by cause.
[1312]     For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
[1313]     For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
[1314]     For we will fetters put upon this fear,
[1315]     For what advancement may I hope from thee,  
[1316]     For what we know must be, and is as common
[1317]     For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
[1318]     For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
[1319]     For your desire to know what is between us,
[1320]     For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
[1321]     Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
[1322]     Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
[1323]     Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
[1324]     Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
[1325]     Free me so far in your most generous thoughts  
[1326]     Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
[1327]     From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
[1328]     From me, whose love was of that dignity
[1329]     From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
[1330]     From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
[1331]     From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
[1332]     From the first corse till he that died to-day,
[1333]     From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
[1334]     Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
[1335]     Get you a place.
[1336]     Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
[1337]     Give him the cup.
[1338]     Give it an understanding but no tongue.
[1339]     Give me my father!
[1340]     Give me one poor request.
[1341]     Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
[1342]     Give us the foils. Come on.
[1343]     Give you good night.                                   Exit.
[1344]     Give, me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
[1345]     Given private time to you, and you yourself
[1346]     Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
[1347]     Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
[1348]     Giving to you no further personal power
[1349]     Go on. I'll follow thee.
[1350]     Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
[1351]     Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
[1352]     Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
[1353]     Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
[1354]     God bless you, sir!
[1355]     God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
[1356]     Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
[1357]     Gonzago'?
[1358]     Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
[1359]     Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
[1360]     Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
[1361]     Good night, mother.
[1362]     Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
[1363]     Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
[1364]     Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
[1365]     Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
[1366]     Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
[1367]     Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
[1368]     Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
[1369]     Had he the motive and the cue for passion
[1370]     Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
[1371]     Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
[1372]     Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
[1373]     Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
[1374]     Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
[1375]     Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
[1376]     Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
[1377]     Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
[1378]     Haply the seas, and countries different,
[1379]     Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
[1380]     Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
[1381]     Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
[1382]     Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
[1383]     Hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been
[1384]     Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
[1385]     Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
[1386]     Have by the very cunning of the scene
[1387]     Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
[1388]     Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
[1389]     Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
[1390]     Have you so slander any moment leisure
[1391]     Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
[1392]     Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
[1393]     He answers:
[1394]     He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
[1395]     He closes with you in this consequence:
[1396]     He falls to such perusal of my face
[1397]     He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
[1398]     He likewise gives a frock or livery,
[1399]     He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
[1400]     He may not, as unvalued persons do,
[1401]     He never gave commandment for their death.
[1402]     He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
[1403]     He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
[1404]     He should the bearers put to sudden death,
[1405]     He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
[1406]     He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
[1407]     He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
[1408]     He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
[1409]     He took my father grossly, full of bread,
[1410]     He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
[1411]     He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
[1412]     Hecuba.
[1413]     Help, help, ho!
[1414]     Her brother is in secret come from France;
[1415]     Her father and myself (lawful espials)
[1416]     Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
[1417]     Her mood will needs be pitied.
[1418]     Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
[1419]     Here in the lobby.
[1420]     Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
[1421]     Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
[1422]     Here's to thy health.
[1423]     Here's yet some liquor left.
[1424]     Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.  
[1425]     Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
[1426]     High on a stage be placed to the view;
[1427]     Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
[1428]     His access to me.
[1429]     His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
[1430]     His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
[1431]     His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
[1432]     His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
[1433]     His further gait herein, in that the levies,
[1434]     His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
[1435]     His liberty is full of threats to all-
[1436]     His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
[1437]     His means of death, his obscure funeral-
[1438]     His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
[1439]     His silence will sit drooping.
[1440]     Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
[1441]     Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
[1442]     Hold you the watch to-night?
[1443]     Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
[1444]     Holds such an enmity with blood of man
[1445]     Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
[1446]     Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
[1447]     How all occasions do inform against me
[1448]     How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
[1449]     How does my good Lord Hamlet?
[1450]     How does your honour for this many a day?
[1451]     How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that
[1452]     How in my words somever she be shent,
[1453]     How much I had to do to calm his rage I
[1454]     How now O What hath befall'n?
[1455]     How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
[1456]     How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
[1457]     How now, sweet queen?
[1458]     How now? What news?
[1459]     How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
[1460]     How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
[1461]     How these things came about. So shall You hear
[1462]     How to forget that learning; but, sir, now  
[1463]     How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
[1464]     Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.
[1465]     Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
[1466]     Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
[1467]     Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
[1468]     I am afeard You make a wanton of me.
[1469]     I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
[1470]     I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
[1471]     I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
[1472]     I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
[1473]     I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
[1474]     I be so able as now.
[1475]     I bought an unction of a mountebank,
[1476]     I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.  
[1477]     I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
[1478]     I cannot live to hear the news from England,
[1479]     I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
[1480]     I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
[1481]     I could not but by her. The other motive
[1482]     I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
[1483]     I did repel his letters and denied
[1484]     I do beseech you give him leave to go.
[1485]     I do not know from what part of the world
[1486]     I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
[1487]     I do receive your offer'd love like love,
[1488]     I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
[1489]     I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
[1490]     I ha't!
[1491]     I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
[1492]     I had my father's signet in my purse,
[1493]     I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
[1494]     I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
[1495]     I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
[1496]     I have a voice and precedent of peace
[1497]     I have in quick determination
[1498]     I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
[1499]     I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
[1500]     I have sworn't.
[1501]     I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe  
[1502]     I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
[1503]     I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
[1504]     I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
[1505]     I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
[1506]     I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
[1507]     I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
[1508]     I made to her in marriage, and to decline
[1509]     I must be cruel, only to be kind;
[1510]     I never gave you aught.
[1511]     I once did hold it, as our statists do,
[1512]     I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
[1513]     I pray you go with me.
[1514]     I pray you, now receive them.
[1515]     I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
[1516]     I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
[1517]     I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
[1518]     I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
[1519]     I shall not look upon his like again.
[1520]     I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
[1521]     I should have fatted all the region kites
[1522]     I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
[1523]     I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
[1524]     I stay too long. But here my father comes.
[1525]     I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
[1526]     I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
[1527]     I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
[1528]     I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
[1529]     I will bestow him, and will answer well
[1530]     I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
[1531]     I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
[1532]     I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
[1533]     I would know that.
[1534]     I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
[1535]     I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
[1536]     I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,  
[1537]     I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
[1538]     I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
[1539]     I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
[1540]     I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
[1541]     I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
[1542]     I'll rant as well as thou.
[1543]     I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
[1544]     I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
[1545]     I'll visit you.
[1546]     I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
[1547]     I, his sole son, do this same villain send
[1548]     If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
[1549]     If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
[1550]     If I had play'd the desk or table book,
[1551]     If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
[1552]     If by direct or by collateral hand
[1553]     If circumstances lead me, I will find
[1554]     If damned custom have not braz'd it so
[1555]     If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
[1556]     If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
[1557]     If his chief good and market of his time
[1558]     If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
[1559]     If it be made of penetrable stuff;
[1560]     If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
[1561]     If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
[1562]     If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
[1563]     If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
[1564]     If there be any good thing to be done,
[1565]     If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
[1566]     If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
[1567]     If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
[1568]     If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
[1569]     If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
[1570]     If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
[1571]     If with too credent ear you list his songs,
[1572]     If you desire to know the certainty
[1573]     If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
[1574]     If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
[1575]     If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his  
[1576]     If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
[1577]     Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
[1578]     Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
[1579]     Importing health and graveness. Two months since
[1580]     Importing the surrender of those lands
[1581]     In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
[1582]     In censure of his seeming.
[1583]     In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
[1584]     In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
[1585]     In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
[1586]     In filial obligation for some term
[1587]     In further evil?
[1588]     In going back to school in Wittenberg,
[1589]     In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
[1590]     In honourable fashion.
[1591]     In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia
[1592]     In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
[1593]     In noise so rude against me?
[1594]     In obstinate condolement is a course
[1595]     In the corrupted currents of this world
[1596]     In the dead vast and middle of the night
[1597]     In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
[1598]     In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
[1599]     In thee there is not half an hour of life.
[1600]     In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
[1601]     In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
[1602]     In which the majesty of buried Denmark
[1603]     Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
[1604]     Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
[1605]     Into a tow'ring passion.
[1606]     Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
[1607]     Into the madness wherein now he raves,
[1608]     Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
[1609]     Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
[1610]     Is by a forged process of my death
[1611]     Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
[1612]     Is it not monstrous that this player here,
[1613]     Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
[1614]     Is not this something more than fantasy?
[1615]     Is not to stir without great argument,
[1616]     Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
[1617]     Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
[1618]     Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
[1619]     Is the great love the general gender bear him,
[1620]     Is the main motive of our preparations,
[1621]     Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
[1622]     Is thought-sick at the act.
[1623]     Is very cunning in.
[1624]     It could not move thus.  
[1625]     It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
[1626]     It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
[1627]     It had been so with us, had we been there.
[1628]     It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
[1629]     It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
[1630]     It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
[1631]     It is a poison temper'd by himself.
[1632]     It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
[1633]     It is most retrograde to our desire;
[1634]     It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
[1635]     It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
[1636]     It lifted up it head and did address
[1637]     It may be death.
[1638]     It sends some precious instance of itself
[1639]     It shall as level to your judgment pierce
[1640]     It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
[1641]     It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
[1642]     It warms the very sickness in my heart
[1643]     It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
[1644]     It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
[1645]     It waves you to a more removed ground.
[1646]     It will be laid to us, whose providence
[1647]     It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
[1648]     Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
[1649]     Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
[1650]     King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
[1651]     King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
[1652]     King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;  
[1653]     King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
[1654]     King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
[1655]     Laertes before you fall to play.  
[1656]     Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
[1657]     Last, and as such containing as all these,
[1658]     Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
[1659]     Leave us.
[1660]     Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down
[1661]     Led by a delicate and tender prince,
[1662]     Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
[1663]     Lest with this piteous action you convert
[1664]     Let Hercules himself do what he may,
[1665]     Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
[1666]     Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
[1667]     Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.  
[1668]     Let his queen mother all alone entreat him  
[1669]     Let it be tenable in your silence still;
[1670]     Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
[1671]     Let me be no assistant for a state,  
[1672]     Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
[1673]     Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
[1674]     Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
[1675]     Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
[1676]     Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
[1677]     Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
[1678]     Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
[1679]     Let us impart what we have seen to-night
[1680]     Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
[1681]     Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,  
[1682]     Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
[1683]     Like a good child and a true gentleman.
[1684]     Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
[1685]     Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
[1686]     Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places  
[1687]     Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
[1688]     Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
[1689]     Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
[1690]     Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
[1691]     Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
[1692]     Look you, I'll go pray.
[1693]     Looking before and after, gave us not
[1694]     Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
[1695]     Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
[1696]     Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
[1697]     Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
[1698]     Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
[1699]     Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
[1700]     Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.
[1701]     Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
[1702]     Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
[1703]     Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
[1704]     Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
[1705]     Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
[1706]     Make you to ravel all this matter out,
[1707]     Makes mouths at the invisible event,  
[1708]     Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
[1709]     Makes vow before his uncle never more
[1710]     Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
[1711]     Marcellus?
[1712]     Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
[1713]     Mark you,
[1714]     May be a devil; and the devil hath power
[1715]     May do t' express his love and friending to you,
[1716]     May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
[1717]     May give his saying deed; which is no further
[1718]     May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
[1719]     May sweep to my revenge.
[1720]     May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
[1721]     Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
[1722]     Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
[1723]     Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
[1724]     Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
[1725]     Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
[1726]     More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
[1727]     More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
[1728]     More relative than this. The play's the thing
[1729]     More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
[1730]     More than in words?
[1731]     Moreover that we much did long to see you,
[1732]     Most free in his reply.
[1733]     Most generous, and free from all contriving,
[1734]     Most holy and religious fear it is
[1735]     Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
[1736]     Most throughly for my father.
[1737]     Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
[1738]     Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
[1739]     Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
[1740]     Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
[1741]     Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
[1742]     Must give us pause. There's the respect
[1743]     Must render up myself.
[1744]     My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
[1745]     My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
[1746]     My custom always of the afternoon,
[1747]     My father's brother, but no more like my father
[1748]     My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
[1749]     My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
[1750]     My father- methinks I see my father.
[1751]     My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
[1752]     My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to
[1753]     My head should be struck off.
[1754]     My liege, and madam, to expostulate
[1755]     My lord, not I.
[1756]     My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
[1757]     My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
[1758]     My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
[1759]     My soul is full of discord and dismay.
[1760]     My stern effects. Then what I have to do
[1761]     My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
[1762]     My tables! Meet it is I set it down
[1763]     My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
[1764]     My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.
[1765]     My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
[1766]     My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
[1767]     My uncle?
[1768]     My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
[1769]     Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
[1770]     Nay, come, let's go together.  
[1771]     Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
[1772]     Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
[1773]     Never to speak of this that you have heard:
[1774]     New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
[1775]     Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author
[1776]     No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
[1777]     No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
[1778]     No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
[1779]     No medicine in the world can do thee good.
[1780]     No more to undertake it, I will work him
[1781]     No more, sweet Hamlet!
[1782]     No more.
[1783]     No more; and by a sleep to say we end
[1784]     No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
[1785]     No reckoning made, but sent to my account
[1786]     No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
[1787]     No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
[1788]     No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
[1789]     No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
[1790]     No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
[1791]     No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
[1792]     No.
[1793]     Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
[1794]     Nor customary suits of solemn black,
[1795]     Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
[1796]     Nor shall you do my ear that violence
[1797]     Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
[1798]     Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
[1799]     Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
[1800]     Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
[1801]     Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
[1802]     Not of that dye which their investments show,
[1803]     Not shriving time allow'd.
[1804]     Now I am alone.  
[1805]     Now fear I this will give it start again;
[1806]     Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
[1807]     Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
[1808]     Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
[1809]     Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
[1810]     Now wears his crown.
[1811]     Now, out of this-
[1812]     O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
[1813]     O good Horatio, what a wounded name
[1814]     O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
[1815]     O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
[1816]     O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
[1817]     O heavy burthen!
[1818]     O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
[1819]     O most pernicious woman!
[1820]     O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
[1821]     O thou vile king,
[1822]     O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
[1823]     O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
[1824]     O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
[1825]     O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
[1826]     O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
[1827]     O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
[1828]     O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
[1829]     O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,  
[1830]     O, ho!
[1831]     O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
[1832]     O, say!
[1833]     O, speak!
[1834]     O, step between her and her fighting soul
[1835]     O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
[1836]     O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
[1837]     O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
[1838]     O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
[1839]     O, vengeance!
[1840]     O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
[1841]     Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
[1842]     Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
[1843]     Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
[1844]     Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
[1845]     Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
[1846]     Of all their conference. If she find him not,
[1847]     Of bell and burial.
[1848]     Of blue Olympus.
[1849]     Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
[1850]     Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
[1851]     Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
[1852]     Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
[1853]     Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
[1854]     Of general assault.  
[1855]     Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
[1856]     Of him that brought them.
[1857]     Of his affection to me.
[1858]     Of his behaviour.
[1859]     Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
[1860]     Of his true state.
[1861]     Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
[1862]     Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
[1863]     Of man and country-
[1864]     Of mighty opposites.
[1865]     Of mine own eyes.  
[1866]     Of my true mother.
[1867]     Of the unworthiest siege.
[1868]     Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
[1869]     Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
[1870]     Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
[1871]     Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
[1872]     Of those effects for which I did the murther-
[1873]     Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
[1874]     Of your dear father's death, is't writ in Your revenge
[1875]     Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
[1876]     Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
[1877]     Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
[1878]     On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
[1879]     On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
[1880]     On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
[1881]     On plots and errors happen.
[1882]     On such regards of safety and allowance
[1883]     One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
[1884]     One word more, good lady.
[1885]     Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
[1886]     Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
[1887]     Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
[1888]     Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
[1889]     Or but a sickly part of one true sense
[1890]     Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
[1891]     Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
[1892]     Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
[1893]     Or for some frontier?
[1894]     Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
[1895]     Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
[1896]     Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
[1897]     Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?  
[1898]     Or like a creature native and indued
[1899]     Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
[1900]     Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
[1901]     Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
[1902]     Or not at all.
[1903]     Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
[1904]     Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
[1905]     Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
[1906]     Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
[1907]     Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
[1908]     Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
[1909]     Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
[1910]     Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
[1911]     Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
[1912]     Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
[1913]     Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
[1914]     Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
[1915]     Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
[1916]     Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
[1917]     Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
[1918]     Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
[1919]     Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,
[1920]     Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
[1921]     Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
[1922]     Out of his lunacies.
[1923]     Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
[1924]     Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
[1925]     Out of the shot and danger of desire.
[1926]     Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
[1927]     Over the nasty sty!
[1928]     Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
[1929]     Passing through nature to eternity.  
[1930]     Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
[1931]     Perchance 'twill walk again.
[1932]     Perpend.
[1933]     Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
[1934]     Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
[1935]     Play something like the murther of my father
[1936]     Pleasant and helpful to him!
[1937]     Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
[1938]     Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
[1939]     Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
[1940]     Pray you be round with him.
[1941]     Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
[1942]     Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
[1943]     Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
[1944]     Pursued my life.
[1945]     Put your dread pleasures more into command
[1946]     Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
[1947]     Queen. O, confound the rest!
[1948]     Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,  
[1949]     Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
[1950]     Queen. The instances that second marriage move
[1951]     Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
[1952]     Receiv'd his love?
[1953]     Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
[1954]     Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
[1955]     Repast them with my blood.
[1956]     Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
[1957]     Requite him for your father.  
[1958]     Resembles that it was. What it should be,
[1959]     Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
[1960]     Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
[1961]     Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
[1962]     Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
[1963]     Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.  
[1964]     Richer than that which four successive kings
[1965]     Rome-
[1966]     Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
[1967]     Rough-hew them how we will-
[1968]     Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
[1969]     Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  
[1970]     Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
[1971]     Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
[1972]     Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
[1973]     See what a grace was seated on this brow;
[1974]     See you now-
[1975]     Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
[1976]     Seem to me all the uses of this world!
[1977]     Set your entreatments at a higher rate
[1978]     Shall in the general censure take corruption
[1979]     Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
[1980]     Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
[1981]     Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
[1982]     She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
[1983]     She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
[1984]     She turns to favour and to prettiness.
[1985]     She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
[1986]     Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
[1987]     Should have a back or second, that might hold
[1988]     Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
[1989]     Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
[1990]     Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
[1991]     Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
[1992]     Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
[1993]     Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
[1994]     Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
[1995]     Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
[1996]     Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
[1997]     Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
[1998]     Sir, in this audience,
[1999]     Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
[2000]     Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
[2001]     Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
[2002]     Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
[2003]     So bloodily hast struck.
[2004]     So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
[2005]     So crimeful and so capital in nature,
[2006]     So excellent a king, that was to this
[2007]     So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
[2008]     So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
[2009]     So full of artless jealousy is guilt
[2010]     So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
[2011]     So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
[2012]     So horridly to shake our disposition
[2013]     So levied as before, against the Polack;
[2014]     So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
[2015]     So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
[2016]     So much as from occasion you may glean,  
[2017]     So much from th' understanding of himself,
[2018]     So nightly toils the subject of the land,
[2019]     So oft it chances in particular men
[2020]     So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
[2021]     So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
[2022]     So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
[2023]     So, by my former lecture and advice,
[2024]     So, proceed you.
[2025]     So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
[2026]     Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
[2027]     Some little time; so by your companies
[2028]     Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
[2029]     Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
[2030]     Speak loudly for him.
[2031]     Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
[2032]     Speak to her, Hamlet.
[2033]     Speak to me.
[2034]     Speak to me.  
[2035]     Speak, man.
[2036]     Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
[2037]     Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
[2038]     Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
[2039]     Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
[2040]     Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
[2041]     Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
[2042]     Stick fiery off indeed.
[2043]     Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
[2044]     Stood challenger on mount of all the age
[2045]     Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
[2046]     Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
[2047]     Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?  
[2048]     Such was the very armour he had on
[2049]     Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
[2050]     Swear by my sword.
[2051]     Swear by my sword.
[2052]     Swear.
[2053]     T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
[2054]     T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
[2055]     T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
[2056]     Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
[2057]     Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
[2058]     Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
[2059]     Take these again; for to the noble mind
[2060]     Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
[2061]     Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
[2062]     Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
[2063]     Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
[2064]     Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
[2065]     Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
[2066]     Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
[2067]     Th' associates tend, and everything is bent

[2069]     Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
[2070]     Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
[2071]     Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
[2072]     Th' important acting of your dread command?
[2073]     Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
[2074]     Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
[2075]     Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
[2076]     Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
[2077]     Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
[2078]     Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
[2079]     Than fly to others that we know not of?
[2080]     Than is my deed to my most painted word.
[2081]     Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
[2082]     Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
[2083]     Than that which dearest father bears his son
[2084]     Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
[2085]     Than to entreaty.
[2086]     Than your particular demands will touch it.
[2087]     That I am guiltless of your father's death,
[2088]     That I essentially am not in madness,
[2089]     That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
[2090]     That I have longed long to re-deliver.
[2091]     That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
[2092]     That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
[2093]     That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
[2094]     That I might be the organ.
[2095]     That I must be their scourge and minister.
[2096]     That I must call't in question.
[2097]     That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
[2098]     That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
[2099]     That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
[2100]     That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
[2101]     That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
[2102]     That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
[2103]     That are but mutes or audience to this act,
[2104]     That are so fortified against our story,
[2105]     That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
[2106]     That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
[2107]     That both the world, I give to negligence,
[2108]     That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
[2109]     That capability and godlike reason
[2110]     That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
[2111]     That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
[2112]     That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
[2113]     That ever I was born to set it right!
[2114]     That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
[2115]     That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  
[2116]     That for a fantasy and trick of fame
[2117]     That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
[2118]     That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
[2119]     That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
[2120]     That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
[2121]     That has no relish of salvation in't-
[2122]     That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
[2123]     That hath in it no profit but the name.
[2124]     That have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
[2125]     That he could nothing do but wish and beg
[2126]     That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
[2127]     That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
[2128]     That he is open to incontinency.
[2129]     That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
[2130]     That he should weep for her? What would he do,
[2131]     That he which hath your noble father slain
[2132]     That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
[2133]     That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
[2134]     That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
[2135]     That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
[2136]     That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
[2137]     That it might please you to give quiet pass
[2138]     That it went hand in hand even with the vow
[2139]     That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
[2140]     That live and feed upon your Majesty.
[2141]     That looks so many fadoms to the sea
[2142]     That makes calamity of so long life.
[2143]     That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
[2144]     That might your nature, honour, and exception
[2145]     That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
[2146]     That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
[2147]     That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
[2148]     That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
[2149]     That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
[2150]     That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
[2151]     That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
[2152]     That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
[2153]     That she should lock herself from his resort,
[2154]     That show of such an exercise may colour
[2155]     That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
[2156]     That so his sickness, age, and impotence
[2157]     That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
[2158]     That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
[2159]     That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
[2160]     That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
[2161]     That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
[2162]     That they do know my son, come you more nearer
[2163]     That they may seem the taints of liberty,
[2164]     That thou so many princes at a shot
[2165]     That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
[2166]     That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
[2167]     That thus he suffers for.
[2168]     That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
[2169]     That to Laertes I forgot myself,
[2170]     That to the use of actions fair and good
[2171]     That treason can but peep to what it would,
[2172]     That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
[2173]     That was and is the question of these wars.
[2174]     That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
[2175]     That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
[2176]     That we find out the cause of this effect-
[2177]     That we with wisest sorrow think on him
[2178]     That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
[2179]     That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
[2180]     That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
[2181]     That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
[2182]     That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
[2183]     That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
[2184]     That your good beauties be the happy cause
[2185]     That youth and observation copied there,
[2186]     That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
[2187]     That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
[2188]     That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,  
[2189]     That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
[2190]     That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
[2191]     That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
[2192]     That, if again this apparition come,
[2193]     That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
[2194]     That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
[2195]     That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
[2196]     That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
[2197]     Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
[2198]     The Devil himself.
[2199]     The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
[2200]     The King is a thing-
[2201]     The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
[2202]     The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
[2203]     The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
[2204]     The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
[2205]     The apparition comes. I knew your father.
[2206]     The bark is ready and the wind at help,
[2207]     The bell then beating one-
[2208]     The better to beguile. This is for all:
[2209]     The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
[2210]     The canker galls the infants of the spring
[2211]     The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
[2212]     The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
[2213]     The changeling never known. Now, the next day  
[2214]     The chariest maid is prodigal enough
[2215]     The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
[2216]     The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
[2217]     The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
[2218]     The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
[2219]     The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
[2220]     The death I gave him. So again, good night.
[2221]     The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
[2222]     The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
[2223]     The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
[2224]     The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
[2225]     The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
[2226]     The form of plausive manners, that these men
[2227]     The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
[2228]     The glowworm shows the matin to be near
[2229]     The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
[2230]     The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
[2231]     The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
[2232]     The head and source of all your son's distemper.
[2233]     The head is not more native to the heart,
[2234]     The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
[2235]     The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
[2236]     The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
[2237]     The imminent death of twenty thousand men
[2238]     The insolence of office, and the spurns
[2239]     The inward service of the mind and soul
[2240]     The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
[2241]     The leperous distilment; whose effect
[2242]     The light and careless livery that it wears
[2243]     The lists, and full proportions are all made
[2244]     The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
[2245]     The memory be green, and that it us befitted
[2246]     The natural gates and alleys of the body,
[2247]     The need we have to use you did provoke
[2248]     The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
[2249]     The ocean, overpeering of his list,
[2250]     The origin and commencement of his grief
[2251]     The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
[2252]     The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
[2253]     The pith and marrow of our attribute.
[2254]     The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
[2255]     The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
[2256]     The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;  
[2257]     The rather, if you could devise it so
[2258]     The ratifiers and props of every word,
[2259]     The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
[2260]     The safety and health of this whole state,
[2261]     The serpent that did sting thy father's life
[2262]     The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
[2263]     The soldiers' music and the rites of war
[2264]     The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
[2265]     The source of this our watch, and the chief head
[2266]     The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
[2267]     The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
[2268]     The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
[2269]     The terms of our estate may not endure
[2270]     The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
[2271]     The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
[2272]     The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
[2273]     The triumph of his pledge.
[2274]     The trumpet to the cannoneer without,  
[2275]     The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
[2276]     The unseen good old man.
[2277]     The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
[2278]     The very faculties of eyes and ears.
[2279]     The very place puts toys of desperation,
[2280]     The very soul, and sweet religion makes
[2281]     The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
[2282]     The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
[2283]     The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
[2284]     The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
[2285]     The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
[2286]     Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
[2287]     Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
[2288]     Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
[2289]     Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
[2290]     Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
[2291]     Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
[2292]     Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
[2293]     Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
[2294]     Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
[2295]     There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
[2296]     There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
[2297]     There is a play to-night before the King.
[2298]     There is no shuffling; there the action lies
[2299]     There lives within the very flame of love
[2300]     There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
[2301]     There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
[2302]     There with fantastic garlands did she come
[2303]     There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
[2304]     There's such divinity doth hedge a king
[2305]     There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
[2306]     There, my lord.
[2307]     Therefore I have entreated him along,  
[2308]     Therefore let's follow.
[2309]     Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
[2310]     Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
[2311]     Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
[2312]     These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
[2313]     These hands are not more like.
[2314]     These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
[2315]     They are not near my conscience; their defeat
[2316]     They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
[2317]     They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
[2318]     They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
[2319]     They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
[2320]     They had begun the play. I sat me down;
[2321]     They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
[2322]     They shall go far with little.  
[2323]     They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
[2324]     Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
[2325]     Thin settled age his sables and his weeds,
[2326]     This above all- to thine own self be true,
[2327]     This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
[2328]     This bodiless creation ecstasy
[2329]     This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
[2330]     This grave shall have a living monument.
[2331]     This heavy-headed revel east and west
[2332]     This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
[2333]     This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
[2334]     This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
[2335]     This is the very ecstasy of love,
[2336]     This mad young man. But so much was our love
[2337]     This man shall set me packing.
[2338]     This marvel to you.
[2339]     This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
[2340]     This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
[2341]     This night to play before him.
[2342]     This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
[2343]     This presence knows,
[2344]     This present object made probation.
[2345]     This something-settled matter in his heart,
[2346]     This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
[2347]     This sudden sending him away must seem
[2348]     This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
[2349]     This unprevailing woe, and think of us
[2350]     This warlike volley.
[2351]     This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
[2352]     This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
[2353]     Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
[2354]     Thou canst not then be false to any man.
[2355]     Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
[2356]     Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
[2357]     Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
[2358]     Thou know'st already.
[2359]     Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright  
[2360]     Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
[2361]     Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
[2362]     Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
[2363]     Though inclination be as sharp as will.
[2364]     Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
[2365]     Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
[2366]     Through your dominions for this enterprise,
[2367]     Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,
[2368]     Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
[2369]     Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
[2370]     Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
[2371]     Thus much the business is: we have here writ
[2372]     Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
[2373]     Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
[2374]     Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
[2375]     Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
[2376]     Till by some elder masters of known honour
[2377]     Till of this flat a mountain you have made
[2378]     Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
[2379]     Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
[2380]     Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
[2381]     Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
[2382]     Till then in patience our proceeding be.
[2383]     Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
[2384]     Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
[2385]     To England send him; or confine him where
[2386]     To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
[2387]     To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
[2388]     To any pastime?
[2389]     To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,  
[2390]     To be commanded.
[2391]     To be contracted in one brow of woe,
[2392]     To be forestalled ere we come to fall,  
[2393]     To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
[2394]     To both your honours.
[2395]     To business with the King, more than the scope
[2396]     To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
[2397]     To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
[2398]     To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  
[2399]     To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
[2400]     To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
[2401]     To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
[2402]     To exploit now ripe in my device,
[2403]     To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
[2404]     To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
[2405]     To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
[2406]     To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
[2407]     To give it due content.
[2408]     To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
[2409]     To give the world assurance of a man.
[2410]     To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.
[2411]     To give these mourning duties to your father;
[2412]     To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
[2413]     To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
[2414]     To hear and see the matter.
[2415]     To hear him so inclin'd.
[2416]     To hear of it. They are here about the court,
[2417]     To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
[2418]     To heaven.
[2419]     To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
[2420]     To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
[2421]     To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.
[2422]     To his confine; and of the truth herein
[2423]     To his unmast'red importunity.
[2424]     To keep it from divulging, let it feed
[2425]     To keep itself from noyance; but much more
[2426]     To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
[2427]     To keep those many many bodies safe
[2428]     To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
[2429]     To lay our service freely at your feet,
[2430]     To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
[2431]     To let this canker of our nature come
[2432]     To let you know of it.
[2433]     To make it truster of your own report
[2434]     To make oppression bitter, or ere this
[2435]     To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;  
[2436]     To mine own room again; making so bold  
[2437]     To muddy death.
[2438]     To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
[2439]     To offer it the show of violence;
[2440]     To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
[2441]     To outface me with leaping in her grave?
[2442]     To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
[2443]     To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
[2444]     To punish me with this, and this with me,
[2445]     To put an antic disposition on),  
[2446]     To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
[2447]     To reason most absurd, whose common theme
[2448]     To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
[2449]     To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
[2450]     To show my duty in your coronation,  
[2451]     To show us so much gentry and good will
[2452]     To show yourself your father's son in deed
[2453]     To sing a requiem and such rest to her
[2454]     To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
[2455]     To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
[2456]     To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
[2457]     To take him in the purging of his soul,
[2458]     To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
[2459]     To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
[2460]     To tell the secrets of my prison house,
[2461]     To tell us this.
[2462]     To the ambassadors of England gives
[2463]     To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
[2464]     To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
[2465]     To the unsatisfied.
[2466]     To those of mine!
[2467]     To try conclusions, in the basket creep
[2468]     To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
[2469]     To what I shall unfold.
[2470]     To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
[2471]     To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
[2472]     To you alone.
[2473]     To you in satisfaction; but if not,  
[2474]     To you yourself, to us, to every one.  
[2475]     To youth and liberty.
[2476]     Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
[2477]     Together with remembrance of ourselves.
[2478]     Together with that fair and warlike form
[2479]     Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
[2480]     Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
[2481]     Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
[2482]     Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
[2483]     Treachery! Seek it out.
[2484]     Truly deliver.
[2485]     Try what repentance can. What can it not?
[2486]     Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
[2487]     Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
[2488]     Under the moon, can save the thing from death
[2489]     Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
[2490]     Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
[2491]     Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
[2492]     Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
[2493]     Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
[2494]     Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
[2495]     Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
[2496]     Unto our climature and countrymen.
[2497]     Unto that element; but long it could not be
[2498]     Unto the voice and yielding of that body
[2499]     Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
[2500]     Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
[2501]     Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
[2502]     Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
[2503]     Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
[2504]     Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
[2505]     Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
[2506]     Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
[2507]     Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
[2508]     Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
[2509]     Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
[2510]     Upon whose property and most dear life
[2511]     Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
[2512]     Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
[2513]     Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
[2514]     Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
[2515]     Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
[2516]     Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
[2517]     Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
[2518]     Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
[2519]     Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
[2520]     Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
[2521]     Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
[2522]     Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
[2523]     We cannot get from him.  
[2524]     We do it wrong, being so majestical,
[2525]     We go to gain a little patch of ground
[2526]     We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
[2527]     We may of their encounter frankly judge
[2528]     We must with all our majesty and skill
[2529]     We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
[2530]     We shall express our duty in his eye;
[2531]     We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
[2532]     We should profane the service of the dead
[2533]     We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
[2534]     We would not understand what was most fit,
[2535]     We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
[2536]     We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
[2537]     We'll put the matter to the present push.-
[2538]     We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
[2539]     Weigh what convenience both of time and means
[2540]     Welcome, my good friends.
[2541]     Well may it sort that this portentous figure
[2542]     Well ratified by law and heraldry,
[2543]     Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
[2544]     Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
[2545]     What I have said to you.
[2546]     What company, at what expense; and finding
[2547]     What does this mean, my lord?
[2548]     What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
[2549]     What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
[2550]     What is between you? Give me up the truth.
[2551]     What is the issue of the business there.  
[2552]     What is the matter?
[2553]     What is the reason that you use me thus?
[2554]     What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
[2555]     What majesty should be, what duty is,
[2556]     What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
[2557]     What might you think? No, I went round to work
[2558]     What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
[2559]     What think you on't?
[2560]     What thou hast said to me.
[2561]     What warlike noise is this?
[2562]     What we two nights have seen.
[2563]     What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
[2564]     What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
[2565]     What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
[2566]     What, have you given him any hard words of late?
[2567]     What, is Horatio there ?
[2568]     When I had seen this hot love on the wing
[2569]     When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
[2570]     When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
[2571]     When down her weedy trophies and herself
[2572]     When he himself might his quietus make
[2573]     When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
[2574]     When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?  
[2575]     When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
[2576]     When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
[2577]     When in one line two crafts directly meet.  
[2578]     When in your motion you are hot and dry-  
[2579]     When it prov'd otherwise.?
[2580]     When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
[2581]     When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
[2582]     When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,  
[2583]     When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
[2584]     When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
[2585]     When thou liest howling.
[2586]     When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
[2587]     When we would bring him on to some confession
[2588]     When yond same star that's westward from the pole
[2589]     Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
[2590]     Where every god did seem to set his seal
[2591]     Where is your son?
[2592]     Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
[2593]     Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
[2594]     Where should We have our thanks?
[2595]     Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
[2596]     Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
[2597]     Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
[2598]     Where you may see the inmost part of you.
[2599]     Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
[2600]     Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.
[2601]     Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
[2602]     Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
[2603]     Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
[2604]     Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts
[2605]     Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
[2606]     Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
[2607]     Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
[2608]     Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
[2609]     Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
[2610]     Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
[2611]     Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
[2612]     Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
[2613]     Which I have told thee, of my father's death.  
[2614]     Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
[2615]     Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
[2616]     Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
[2617]     Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
[2618]     Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
[2619]     Which is not tomb enough and continent
[2620]     Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
[2621]     Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
[2622]     Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
[2623]     Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
[2624]     Which now goes too free-footed.
[2625]     Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
[2626]     Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
[2627]     Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
[2628]     Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
[2629]     Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
[2630]     Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
[2631]     Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
[2632]     Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
[2633]     Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
[2634]     Who hath reliev'd you?
[2635]     Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
[2636]     Who is't that can inform me?
[2637]     Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
[2638]     Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
[2639]     Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
[2640]     Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
[2641]     Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
[2642]     Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
[2643]     Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
[2644]     Whose motive in this case should stir me most
[2645]     Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
[2646]     Whose violent property fordoes itself  
[2647]     Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
[2648]     Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
[2649]     Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
[2650]     Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
[2651]     Why does the drum come hither?
[2652]     Why seems it so particular with thee?
[2653]     Why should we in our peevish opposition
[2654]     Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
[2655]     Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
[2656]     Why this same strict and most observant watch
[2657]     Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
[2658]     Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
[2659]     Why to a public count I might not go
[2660]     Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
[2661]     Why you proceeded not against these feats
[2662]     Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
[2663]     Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
[2664]     Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
[2665]     Will bring him to his wonted way again,
[2666]     Will not debate the question of this straw.
[2667]     Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
[2668]     Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
[2669]     Will return'd shall know you are come home.
[2670]     Will sate itself in a celestial bed
[2671]     Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
[2672]     Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
[2673]     Will you be rul'd by me?
[2674]     Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
[2675]     Winner and loser?
[2676]     With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
[2677]     With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
[2678]     With all my imperfections on my head.
[2679]     With all my love I do commend me to you;
[2680]     With all the strength and armour of the mind
[2681]     With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
[2682]     With an attent ear, till I may deliver
[2683]     With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
[2684]     With an entreaty, herein further shown,
[2685]     With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
[2686]     With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
[2687]     With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
[2688]     With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
[2689]     With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
[2690]     With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
[2691]     With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
[2692]     With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
[2693]     With sore distraction. What I have done
[2694]     With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
[2695]     With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
[2696]     With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
[2697]     With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
[2698]     With this regard their currents turn awry
[2699]     With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
[2700]     With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
[2701]     With tristful visage, as against the doom,
[2702]     With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
[2703]     With us to watch the minutes of this night,
[2704]     With variable objects, shall expel
[2705]     With which she followed my poor father's body
[2706]     With windlasses and with assays of bias,
[2707]     With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
[2708]     With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
[2709]     With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
[2710]     Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd  
[2711]     Within the book and volume of my brain,
[2712]     Within the centre.
[2713]     Without debatement further, more or less,
[2714]     Without more motive, into every brain
[2715]     Without the sensible and true avouch
[2716]     Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts;
[2717]     Witness this army of such mass and charge,
[2718]     Woo't drink up esill? eat a crocodile?
[2719]     Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
[2720]     Words without thoughts never to heaven go.             Exit.
[2721]     Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-
[2722]     Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
[2723]     Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
[2724]     Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
[2725]     Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
[2726]     Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;  
[2727]     Would have reverted to my bow again,
[2728]     Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
[2729]     Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my
[2730]     Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
[2731]     Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
[2732]     Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
[2733]     Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
[2734]     Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
[2735]     Yea, from the table of my memory
[2736]     Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
[2737]     Yes, faith, heartily.
[2738]     Yet I,
[2739]     Yet have I in me something dangerous,
[2740]     Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
[2741]     Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
[2742]     Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
[2743]     Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
[2744]     Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
[2745]     Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
[2746]     Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
[2747]     You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
[2748]     You are the most immediate to our throne,
[2749]     You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee
[2750]     You cannot call it love; for at your age
[2751]     You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
[2752]     You do not understand yourself so clearly
[2753]     You do remember all the circumstance?
[2754]     You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
[2755]     You go not till I set you up a glass
[2756]     You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
[2757]     You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
[2758]     You know the wager?
[2759]     You laying these slight sullies on my son
[2760]     You mainly were stirr'd up.
[2761]     You must not put another scandal on him,
[2762]     You must not take for fire. From this time
[2763]     You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
[2764]     You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
[2765]     You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
[2766]     You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
[2767]     You, as your business and desires shall point you,
[2768]     You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
[2769]     Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
[2770]     Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
[2771]     Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
[2772]     Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
[2773]     Your leave and favour to return to France;
[2774]     Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
[2775]     Your party in converse, him you would sound,
[2776]     Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,
[2777]     Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.
[2778]     Your visitation shall receive such thanks
[2779]     Your wisdom best shall think.

[3272]   Both. My lord, from head to foot.
[3273]   Both. My lord, we will not.
[3274]   Both. We will haste us.
[3275]   Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.

[3311]   Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
[3312]   Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
[3313]   Clown. Why, because 'a was mad. 'A shall recover his wits there;

[3327]   Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.  
[3328]   Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
[3329]   Fran. Bernardo?
[3330]   Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
[3331]   Fran. Give you good night.
[3332]   Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
[3333]   Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
[3334]   Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
[3335]   Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.

[3343]   Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
[3344]   Ghost. I am thy father's spirit,
[3345]   Ghost. I find thee apt;

[3347]   Ghost. Mark me.
[3348]   Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is;

[3356]   Ghost. [beneath] Swear.
[3357]   Guil. A thing, my lord?
[3358]   Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
[3359]   Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
[3360]   Guil. But we both obey,
[3361]   Guil. But with much forcing of his disposition.
[3362]   Guil. Faith, her privates we.
[3363]   Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
[3364]   Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
[3365]   Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
[3366]   Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
[3367]   Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
[3368]   Guil. In what, my dear lord?
[3369]   Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.  
[3370]   Guil. My honour'd lord!
[3371]   Guil. My lord, I cannot.
[3372]   Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
[3373]   Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
[3374]   Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
[3375]   Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
[3376]   Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
[3377]   Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
[3378]   Guil. Prison, my lord?  
[3379]   Guil. The King, sir-
[3380]   Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
[3381]   Guil. There are the players.
[3382]   Guil. We will ourselves provide.
[3383]   Guil. What should we say, my lord?
[3384]   Guil. What, my lord?
[3385]   Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
[3386]   Guildenstern, courtier.
[3387]   Ham.   A whole one I!
[3388]   Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
[3389]   Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
[3390]   Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
[3391]   Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
[3392]   Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
[3393]   Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
[3394]   Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
[3395]   Ham. 'Tis very strange.
[3396]   Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
[3397]   Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
[3398]   Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
[3399]   Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
[3400]   Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
[3401]   Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
[3402]   Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
[3403]   Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
[3404]   Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
[3405]   Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
[3406]   Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
[3407]   Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
[3408]   Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
[3409]   Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
[3410]   Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
[3411]   Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
[3412]   Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
[3413]   Ham. Are you fair?
[3414]   Ham. Arm'd, say you?
[3415]   Ham. As th'art a man,
[3416]   Ham. As woman's love.
[3417]   Ham. At supper.
[3418]   Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
[3419]   Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
[3420]   Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
[3421]   Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
[3422]   Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
[3423]   Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
[3424]   Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
[3425]   Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
[3426]   Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,  
[3427]   Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
[3428]   Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
[3429]   Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
[3430]   Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
[3431]   Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
[3432]   Ham. Between who?
[3433]   Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
[3434]   Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
[3435]   Ham. But where was this?
[3436]   Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
[3437]   Ham. Buzz, buzz!
[3438]   Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
[3439]   Ham. Come on, sir.
[3440]   Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I
[3441]   Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
[3442]   Ham. Denmark's a prison.
[3443]   Ham. Did you not speak to it?
[3444]   Ham. Do not believe it.
[3445]   Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
[3446]   Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
[3447]   Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
[3448]   Ham. Do you see nothing there?
[3449]   Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
[3450]   Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
[3451]   Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
[3452]   Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
[3453]   Ham. Ecstasy?
[3454]   Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
[3455]   Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
[3456]   Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
[3457]   Ham. For England?
[3458]   Ham. For God's love let me hear!
[3459]   Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
[3460]   Ham. From top to toe?
[3461]   Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
[3462]   Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
[3463]   Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
[3464]   Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
[3465]   Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
[3466]   Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
[3467]   Ham. Good madam!
[3468]   Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
[3469]   Ham. Good.  
[3470]   Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
[3471]   Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
[3472]   Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
[3473]   Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
[3474]   Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
[3475]   Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.  
[3476]   Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
[3477]   Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
[3478]   Ham. He will stay till you come.
[3479]   Ham. Hear you, sir!
[3480]   Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
[3481]   Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
[3482]   Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
[3483]   Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
[3484]   Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
[3485]   Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
[3486]   Ham. Hold off your hands!
[3487]   Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
[3488]   Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
[3489]   Ham. How came he mad?
[3490]   Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
[3491]   Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
[3492]   Ham. How does the Queen?
[3493]   Ham. How if I answer no?
[3494]   Ham. How is it with you, lady?
[3495]   Ham. How long is that since?
[3496]   Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
[3497]   Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
[3498]   Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
[3499]   Ham. How strangely?
[3500]   Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
[3501]   Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
[3502]   Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
[3503]   Ham. I am glad to see you well.
[3504]   Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
[3505]   Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
[3506]   Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
[3507]   Ham. I beseech you remember.
[3508]   Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
[3509]   Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
[3510]   Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
[3511]   Ham. I do beseech you.
[3512]   Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
[3513]   Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
[3514]   Ham. I embrace it freely,
[3515]   Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
[3516]   Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
[3517]   Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
[3518]   Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
[3519]   Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
[3520]   Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
[3521]   Ham. I must to England; you know that?
[3522]   Ham. I pray you.
[3523]   Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
[3524]   Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
[3525]   Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
[3526]   Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
[3527]   Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
[3528]   Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
[3529]   Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
[3530]   Ham. I will watch to-night.
[3531]   Ham. I will.
[3532]   Ham. I would I had been there.
[3533]   Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
[3534]   Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
[3535]   Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.  
[3536]   Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
[3537]   Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
[3538]   Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
[3539]   Ham. If she should break it now!
[3540]   Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
[3541]   Ham. In happy time.
[3542]   Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
[3543]   Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
[3544]   Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
[3545]   Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
[3546]   Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
[3547]   Ham. Into my grave?
[3548]   Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
[3549]   Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
[3550]   Ham. Is't possible?
[3551]   Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
[3552]   Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
[3553]   Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
[3554]   Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
[3555]   Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
[3556]   Ham. It waves me still.
[3557]   Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
[3558]   Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
[3559]   Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
[3560]   Ham. Judgment!
[3561]   Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
[3562]   Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
[3563]   Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,  
[3564]   Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
[3565]   Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
[3566]   Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
[3567]   Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
[3568]   Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.  
[3569]   Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
[3570]   Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
[3571]   Ham. Murther?
[3572]   Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
[3573]   Ham. My fate cries out
[3574]   Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
[3575]   Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
[3576]   Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.  
[3577]   Ham. Nay, I know not.
[3578]   Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
[3579]   Ham. Nay, but swear't.
[3580]   Ham. Nay, but to live
[3581]   Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
[3582]   Ham. Nay, that follows not.
[3583]   Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
[3584]   Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
[3585]   Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
[3586]   Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
[3587]   Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
[3588]   Ham. No, by this bad.  
[3589]   Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
[3590]   Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
[3591]   Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
[3592]   Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
[3593]   Ham. No, not I!
[3594]   Ham. No, you will reveal it.
[3595]   Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
[3596]   Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
[3597]   Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
[3598]   Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
[3599]   Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
[3600]   Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
[3601]   Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
[3602]   Ham. Nothing.
[3603]   Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
[3604]   Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
[3605]   Ham. O God!
[3606]   Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
[3607]   Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
[3608]   Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
[3609]   Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
[3610]   Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
[3611]   Ham. O my prophetic soul!
[3612]   Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
[3613]   Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
[3614]   Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
[3615]   Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
[3616]   Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
[3617]   Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
[3618]   Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
[3619]   Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
[3620]   Ham. Of him, sir.
[3621]   Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
[3622]   Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
[3623]   Ham. One.
[3624]   Ham. Or like a whale.
[3625]   Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
[3626]   Ham. Pale or red?
[3627]   Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
[3628]   Ham. Safely stow'd.
[3629]   Ham. Saw? who?
[3630]   Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
[3631]   Ham. She well instructs me.
[3632]   Ham. Sir, I cannot.
[3633]   Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
[3634]   Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
[3635]   Ham. Sir, a whole history.
[3636]   Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I  
[3637]   Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
[3638]   Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
[3639]   Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
[3640]   Ham. So be it!
[3641]   Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
[3642]   Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
[3643]   Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
[3644]   Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
[3645]   Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
[3646]   Ham. Such an act
[3647]   Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
[3648]   Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
[3649]   Ham. That is Laertes,
[3650]   Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
[3651]   Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
[3652]   Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
[3653]   Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
[3654]   Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
[3655]   Ham. The King my father?
[3656]   Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
[3657]   Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
[3658]   Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
[3659]   Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
[3660]   Ham. The point envenom'd too?
[3661]   Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
[3662]   Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
[3663]   Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
[3664]   Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
[3665]   Ham. Then saw you not his face?
[3666]   Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
[3667]   Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
[3668]   Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
[3669]   Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
[3670]   Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
[3671]   Ham. These tedious old fools!
[3672]   Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.  
[3673]   Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I  
[3674]   Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
[3675]   Ham. This?
[3676]   Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
[3677]   Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
[3678]   Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
[3679]   Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
[3680]   Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
[3681]   Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
[3682]   Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
[3683]   Ham. Up from my cabin,
[3684]   Ham. Upon my sword.
[3685]   Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
[3686]   Ham. Upon what ground?
[3687]   Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
[3688]   Ham. Very well, my lord.
[3689]   Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
[3690]   Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
[3691]   Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
[3692]   Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
[3693]   Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
[3694]   Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
[3695]   Ham. What call you the carriages?
[3696]   Ham. What did you enact?
[3697]   Ham. What hour now?
[3698]   Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
[3699]   Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
[3700]   Ham. What woman then?
[3701]   Ham. What's his weapon?
[3702]   Ham. What's the matter now?
[3703]   Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
[3704]   Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
[3705]   Ham. What, ho, Horatio!
[3706]   Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
[3707]   Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
[3708]   Ham. What?
[3709]   Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
[3710]   Ham. Who commands them, sir?
[3711]   Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
[3712]   Ham. Who, I?
[3713]   Ham. Whose was it?
[3714]   Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
[3715]   Ham. Why he more than another?
[3716]   Ham. Why,
[3717]   Ham. Why,
[3718]   Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
[3719]   Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
[3720]   Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
[3721]   Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
[3722]   Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
[3723]   Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!  
[3724]   Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
[3725]   Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
[3726]   Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
[3727]   Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
[3728]   Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
[3729]   Ham. Why?
[3730]   Ham. With drink, sir?
[3731]   Ham. Words, words, words.
[3732]   Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
[3733]   Ham. You are welcome.
[3734]   Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
[3735]   Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
[3736]   Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
[3737]   Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
[3738]   Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
[3739]   Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
[3740]   Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
[3741]   Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
[3742]   Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
[3743]   Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief  
[3744]   Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
[3745]   Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
[3746]   Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
[3747]   Hor. 'Tis here!
[3748]   Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
[3749]   Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.  
[3750]   Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
[3751]   Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
[3752]   Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
[3753]   Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
[3754]   Hor. A piece of him.
[3755]   Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
[3756]   Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
[3757]   Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
[3758]   Hor. As thou art to thyself.
[3759]   Hor. Ay, good my lord.
[3760]   Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
[3761]   Hor. Ay, my lord.
[3762]   Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
[3763]   Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
[3764]   Hor. Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness.
[3765]   Hor. Do not, my lord!
[3766]   Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
[3767]   Hor. E'en so, my lord.
[3768]   Hor. E'en so.
[3769]   Hor. Friends to this ground.
[3770]   Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
[3771]   Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
[3772]   Hor. Hail to your lordship!
[3773]   Hor. Half a share.
[3774]   Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
[3775]   Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
[3776]   Hor. Heaven secure him!
[3777]   Hor. Heaven will direct it.
[3778]   Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
[3779]   Hor. How was this seal'd?
[3780]   Hor. I beseech you.
[3781]   Hor. I did very well note him.
[3782]   Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
[3783]   Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
[3784]   Hor. I warr'nt it will.
[3785]   Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
[3786]   Hor. In faith,
[3787]   Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
[3788]   Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
[3789]   Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
[3790]   Hor. Is it a custom?
[3791]   Hor. Is't possible?
[3792]   Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
[3793]   Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
[3794]   Hor. It might, my lord.
[3795]   Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
[3796]   Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
[3797]   Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
[3798]   Hor. Let him bless thee too.
[3799]   Hor. Let them come in.
[3800]   Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
[3801]   Hor. Most constantly.
[3802]   Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
[3803]   Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
[3804]   Hor. My lord, I did;
[3805]   Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
[3806]   Hor. My lord, the King your father.
[3807]   Hor. Nay, good my lord -
[3808]   Hor. Nay, very pale.
[3809]   Hor. Never believe it.
[3810]   Hor. No, by no means!
[3811]   Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
[3812]   Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
[3813]   Hor. Not from his mouth,
[3814]   Hor. Not when I saw't.
[3815]   Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
[3816]   Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
[3817]   Hor. O, my dear lord!
[3818]   Hor. O, where, my lord?
[3819]   Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
[3820]   Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
[3821]   Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
[3822]   Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.  
[3823]   Hor. Remember it, my lord!
[3824]   Hor. Season your admiration for a while
[3825]   Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
[3826]   Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
[3827]   Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
[3828]   Hor. That can I.
[3829]   Hor. That is most certain.
[3830]   Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
[3831]   Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
[3832]   Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
[3833]   Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
[3834]   Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
[3835]   Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  
[3836]   Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
[3837]   Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
[3838]   Hor. Very well, my lord.
[3839]   Hor. Well, my lord.
[3840]   Hor. Well, sit we down,
[3841]   Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
[3842]   Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
[3843]   Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
[3844]   Hor. What is it you will see?
[3845]   Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
[3846]   Hor. What news, my lord?
[3847]   Hor. What's that, my lord?
[3848]   Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
[3849]   Hor. Why, what a king is this!
[3850]   Hor. You might have rhym'd.
[3851]   Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
[3852]   Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
[3853]   Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
[3854]   Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
[3855]   Horatio, friend to Hamlet.
[3856]   King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
[3857]   King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
[3858]   King. A Norman.
[3859]   King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
[3860]   King. Alas, alas!
[3861]   King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
[3862]   King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
[3863]   King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
[3864]   King. At supper? Where?
[3865]   King. Ay, Hamlet.
[3866]   King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
[3867]   King. Bring him before us.
[3868]   King. But how hath she
[3869]   King. But where is he?
[3870]   King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
[3871]   King. Conceit upon her father.
[3872]   King. Dead.
[3873]   King. Do you think 'tis this?
[3874]   King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
[3875]   King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
[3876]   King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
[3877]   King. Gertrude, do not drink.
[3878]   King. Give me some light! Away!
[3879]   King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
[3880]   King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
[3881]   King. Good Laertes,
[3882]   King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
[3883]   King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
[3884]   King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
[3885]   King. He made confession of you;
[3886]   King. How do you, pretty lady?
[3887]   King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
[3888]   King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
[3889]   King. How long hath she been thus?
[3890]   King. How may we try it further?
[3891]   King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
[3892]   King. I do not think't.
[3893]   King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
[3894]   King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
[3895]   King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
[3896]   King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
[3897]   King. If it be so, Laertes
[3898]   King. It falls right.
[3899]   King. It likes us well;
[3900]   King. It shall be so.
[3901]   King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
[3902]   King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
[3903]   King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
[3904]   King. Let him demand his fill.
[3905]   King. Let's follow, Gertrude.  
[3906]   King. Let's further think of this,
[3907]   King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;  
[3908]   King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
[3909]   King. Not that I know.
[3910]   King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
[3911]   King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
[3912]   King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
[3913]   King. O Gertrude, come away!
[3914]   King. O heavy deed!
[3915]   King. O, for two special reasons,
[3916]   King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
[3917]   King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
[3918]   King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
[3919]   King. Our son shall win.
[3920]   King. Part them! They are incens'd.
[3921]   King. Pluck thein asunder.
[3922]   King. Pretty Ophelia!
[3923]   King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
[3924]   King. She sounds to see them bleed.
[3925]   King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
[3926]   King. So you shall;
[3927]   King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
[3928]   King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
[3929]   King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
[3930]   King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
[3931]   King. Thanks, dear my lord.
[3932]   King. The doors are broke.
[3933]   King. The very same.
[3934]   King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
[3935]   King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
[3936]   King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
[3937]   King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
[3938]   King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
[3939]   King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
[3940]   King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
[3941]   King. We will try it.
[3942]   King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[3943]   King. Well, we shall sift him.
[3944]   King. What do you call the play?
[3945]   King. What dost thou mean by this?  
[3946]   King. What is the cause, Laertes,
[3947]   King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
[3948]   King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
[3949]   King. Where is Polonius?
[3950]   King. Who shall stay you?
[3951]   King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
[3952]   King. Why, now You speak
[3953]   King. Will you know them then?
[3954]   King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
[3955]   King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
[3956]   King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
[3957]   King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
[3958]   Laer. A Norman was't?
[3959]   Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
[3960]   Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
[3961]   Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
[3962]   Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
[3963]   Laer. Ay my lord,
[3964]   Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
[3965]   Laer. Come, one for me.
[3966]   Laer. Do you see this, O God?
[3967]   Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
[3968]   Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
[3969]   Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
[3970]   Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
[3971]   Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
[3972]   Laer. Have at you now!
[3973]   Laer. He is justly serv'd.
[3974]   Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
[3975]   Laer. How now? What noise is that?
[3976]   Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
[3977]   Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
[3978]   Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
[3979]   Laer. I pray you give me leave.
[3980]   Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
[3981]   Laer. I will do't!
[3982]   Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
[3983]   Laer. It well appears. But tell me
[3984]   Laer. Know you the hand?
[3985]   Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
[3986]   Laer. Let this be so.
[3987]   Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
[3988]   Laer. Must there no more be done?
[3989]   Laer. My dread lord,
[3990]   Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
[3991]   Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
[3992]   Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
[3993]   Laer. My will, not all the world!
[3994]   Laer. No.
[3995]   Laer. None but his enemies.
[3996]   Laer. O, fear me not!
[3997]   Laer. O, treble woe
[3998]   Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
[3999]   Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
[4000]   Laer. The devil take thy soul!
[4001]   Laer. Think it no more.
[4002]   Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
[4003]   Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
[4004]   Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
[4005]   Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
[4006]   Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
[4007]   Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
[4008]   Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
[4009]   Laer. Well, again!
[4010]   Laer. What ceremony else?
[4011]   Laer. What ceremony else?
[4012]   Laer. What out of this, my lord?
[4013]   Laer. What part is that, my lord?
[4014]   Laer. Where is my father?
[4015]   Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
[4016]   Laer. Why ask you this?
[4017]   Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
[4018]   Laer. You mock me, sir.
[4019]   Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
[4020]   Laertes, son to Polonius.
[4021]   Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
[4022]   Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
[4023]   Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
[4024]   Lords, ladies, Officers, Soldiers, Sailors, Messengers, Attendants.
[4025]   Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
[4026]   Mar. 'Tis gone!
[4027]   Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
[4028]   Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
[4029]   Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
[4030]   Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
[4031]   Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
[4032]   Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
[4033]   Mar. Is it not like the King?
[4034]   Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
[4035]   Mar. It is offended.
[4036]   Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
[4037]   Mar. Look with what courteous action
[4038]   Mar. Lord Hamlet!
[4039]   Mar. My good lord!
[4040]   Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
[4041]   Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
[4042]   Mar. No, it is struck.
[4043]   Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
[4044]   Mar. Nor I, my lord.
[4045]   Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
[4046]   Mar. O, wonderful!
[4047]   Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
[4048]   Mar. Question it, Horatio.
[4049]   Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
[4050]   Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[4051]   Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
[4052]   Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
[4053]   Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
[4054]   Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
[4055]   Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
[4056]   Marcellus, Officer.
[4057]   Marcellus, officer.
[4058]   Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
[4059]   Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
[4060]   Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
[4061]   Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
[4062]   Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
[4063]   Oph. (Sings)
[4064]   Oph. (sings)
[4065]   Oph. (sings)
[4066]   Oph. (sings)
[4067]   Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
[4068]   Oph. At home, my lord.
[4069]   Oph. Ay, my lord.
[4070]   Oph. Ay, my lord.
[4071]   Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
[4072]   Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
[4073]   Oph. Do you doubt that?
[4074]   Oph. Good my lord,
[4075]   Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
[4076]   Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
[4077]   Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
[4078]   Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
[4079]   Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
[4080]   Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
[4081]   Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
[4082]   Oph. I was the more deceived.
[4083]   Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
[4084]   Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
[4085]   Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
[4086]   Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
[4087]   Oph. My lord, I do not know,
[4088]   Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
[4089]   Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
[4090]   Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
[4091]   Oph. My lord?
[4092]   Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
[4093]   Oph. No more but so?
[4094]   Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
[4095]   Oph. No, my lord.
[4096]   Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
[4097]   Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
[4098]   Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
[4099]   Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
[4100]   Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
[4101]   Oph. Pray you mark.
[4102]   Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.
[4103]   Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  
[4104]   Oph. Still better, and worse.
[4105]   Oph. The King rises.
[4106]   Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
[4107]   Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
[4108]   Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.  
[4109]   Oph. What is, my lord?
[4110]   Oph. What means this, my lord?
[4111]   Oph. What means your lordship?
[4112]   Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
[4113]   Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
[4114]   Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
[4115]   Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
[4116]   Oph. You are merry, my lord.
[4117]   Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
[4118]   Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
[4119]   Ophelia, daughter to Polonius.
[4120]   Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
[4121]   Osr. Ay, my good lord.
[4122]   Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot
[4123]   Osr. How is't, Laertes?
[4124]   Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
[4125]   Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
[4126]   Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
[4127]   Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
[4128]   Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
[4129]   Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
[4130]   Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
[4131]   Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
[4132]   Osr. Nothing neither way.
[4133]   Osr. Of Laertes?
[4134]   Osr. Rapier and dagger.
[4135]   Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
[4136]   Osr. Sir?
[4137]   Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart
[4138]   Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
[4139]   Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
[4140]   Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
[4141]   Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
[4142]   Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
[4143]   Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
[4144]   Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
[4145]   Osric, courtier.
[4146]   Other. But is this law?
[4147]   Other. Go to!
[4148]   Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
[4149]   Other. Marry, now I can tell!
[4150]   Other. Mass, I cannot tell.
[4151]   Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
[4152]   Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand  
[4153]   Other. Was he a gentleman?
[4154]   Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
[4155]   Other. Why, 'tis found so.
[4156]   Other. Why, he had none.
[4157]   Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
[4158]   Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
[4159]   Player. I warrant your honour.
[4160]   Players.
[4161]   Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
[4162]   Pol. 'Tis most true;
[4163]   Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
[4164]   Pol. And let him ply his music.
[4165]   Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
[4166]   Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
[4167]   Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
[4168]   Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
[4169]   Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
[4170]   Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
[4171]   Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
[4172]   Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
[4173]   Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
[4174]   Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
[4175]   Pol. Come, sirs.
[4176]   Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
[4177]   Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
[4178]   Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
[4179]   Pol. Farewell!
[4180]   Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
[4181]   Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
[4182]   Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
[4183]   Pol. Give o'er the play.
[4184]   Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
[4185]   Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]  
[4186]   Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
[4187]   Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
[4188]   Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
[4189]   Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
[4190]   Pol. Honest, my lord?
[4191]   Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
[4192]   Pol. I have, my lord.
[4193]   Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
[4194]   Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
[4195]   Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
[4196]   Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,  
[4197]   Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
[4198]   Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
[4199]   Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
[4200]   Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
[4201]   Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
[4202]   Pol. Mad for thy love?  
[4203]   Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
[4204]   Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
[4205]   Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
[4206]   Pol. Marry, well bethought!
[4207]   Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
[4208]   Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
[4209]   Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
[4210]   Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
[4211]   Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
[4212]   Pol. Not I, my lord.
[4213]   Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
[4214]   Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
[4215]   Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
[4216]   Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
[4217]   Pol. That hath made him mad.
[4218]   Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
[4219]   Pol. That's very true, my lord.
[4220]   Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
[4221]   Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
[4222]   Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
[4223]   Pol. This business is well ended.
[4224]   Pol. This is too long.
[4225]   Pol. Upon my honour-
[4226]   Pol. Very like a whale.
[4227]   Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
[4228]   Pol. What do you think of me?
[4229]   Pol. What follows then, my lord?
[4230]   Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
[4231]   Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
[4232]   Pol. What said he?
[4233]   Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
[4234]   Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
[4235]   Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
[4236]   Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
[4237]   Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
[4238]   Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
[4239]   Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
[4240]   Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
[4241]   Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
[4242]   Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
[4243]   Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
[4244]   Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
[4245]   Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
[4246]   Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
[4247]   Polonius, Lord Chamberlain.
[4248]   Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
[4249]   Priest. No more be done.
[4250]   Queen. Alack,
[4251]   Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
[4252]   Queen. Alas, he's mad!
[4253]   Queen. Alas, how is't with you,  
[4254]   Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
[4255]   Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
[4256]   Queen. As kill a king?
[4257]   Queen. Ay me, what act,
[4258]   Queen. Ay, amen!
[4259]   Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
[4260]   Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
[4261]   Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
[4262]   Queen. But not by him!
[4263]   Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
[4264]   Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
[4265]   Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
[4266]   Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
[4267]   Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
[4268]   Queen. Did he receive you well?
[4269]   Queen. Did you assay him  
[4270]   Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
[4271]   Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
[4272]   Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
[4273]   Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
[4274]   Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
[4275]   Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
[4276]   Queen. Have you forgot me?
[4277]   Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
[4278]   Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!  
[4279]   Queen. How fares my lord?
[4280]   Queen. How now, Ophelia?
[4281]   Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
[4282]   Queen. I shall obey you;
[4283]   Queen. I will not speak with her.
[4284]   Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
[4285]   Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.
[4286]   Queen. If it be,
[4287]   Queen. Let her come in.  
[4288]   Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
[4289]   Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
[4290]   Queen. More matter, with less art.
[4291]   Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
[4292]   Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
[4293]   Queen. No more!
[4294]   Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
[4295]   Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
[4296]   Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
[4297]   Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
[4298]   Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
[4299]   Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
[4300]   Queen. O my son, what theme?  
[4301]   Queen. O, speak to me no more!
[4302]   Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
[4303]   Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
[4304]   Queen. So he does indeed.
[4305]   Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
[4306]   Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.  
[4307]   Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
[4308]   Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
[4309]   Queen. This is mere madness;
[4310]   Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
[4311]   Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
[4312]   Queen. To whom do you speak this?
[4313]   Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
[4314]   Queen. What shall I do?
[4315]   Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
[4316]   Queen. What would she have?
[4317]   Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?  
[4318]   Queen. it may be, very like.
[4319]   Rey. As gaming, my lord.
[4320]   Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and  
[4321]   Rey. Ay, my lord,
[4322]   Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.  
[4323]   Rey. But, my good lord-
[4324]   Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
[4325]   Rey. I shall, my lord.
[4326]   Rey. I will, my lord.
[4327]   Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
[4328]   Rey. My lord, I have.
[4329]   Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
[4330]   Rey. Very good, my lord.
[4331]   Rey. Well, my lord.
[4332]   Reynaldo, servant to Polonius.
[4333]   Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
[4334]   Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
[4335]   Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
[4336]   Ros. Believe what?
[4337]   Ros. Both your Majesties
[4338]   Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
[4339]   Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
[4340]   Ros. Good my lord!
[4341]   Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
[4342]   Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
[4343]   Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
[4344]   Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
[4345]   Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself
[4346]   Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
[4347]   Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
[4348]   Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
[4349]   Ros. Most like a gentleman.
[4350]   Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
[4351]   Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
[4352]   Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
[4353]   Ros. My most dear lord!
[4354]   Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
[4355]   Ros. Neither, my lord.
[4356]   Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
[4357]   Ros. No indeed are they not.  
[4358]   Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
[4359]   Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
[4360]   Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
[4361]   Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
[4362]   Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
[4363]   Ros. Then is the world one.
[4364]   Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
[4365]   Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
[4366]   Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
[4367]   Ros. To what end, my lord?
[4368]   Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
[4369]   Ros. We shall, my lord.
[4370]   Ros. We think not so, my lord.
[4371]   Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
[4372]   Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
[4373]   Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
[4374]   Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
[4375]   Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
[4376]   Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
[4377]   Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
[4378]   Rosencrantz, courtier.
[4379]   Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
[4380]   Sailor. God bless you, sir.
